# **Early Admission Evaluations & Notifications**

As determined by the TUOS Office of Admissions, some applicants may receive an early evaluation of their admission prospects, intended to assist them in planning their academic futures.

### **Preliminary Evaluations**

Beginning **October 1** of a student’s senior year, TUOS may issue preliminary assessments indicating one of the following:

- **Likely** – The applicant is highly competitive for admission and, provided they maintain their academic and personal standing, will likely be admitted when decisions are released.
- **Possible** – The applicant remains under strong consideration, with a final decision to be determined in the full review process.
- **Unlikely** – Based on the current application, admission is not expected.

Applicants receiving **Likely Letters** are encouraged to sustain their academic performance and are advised to notify other institutions of their enrollment decisions once they have committed to TUOS.

### **Faculty & Academic Mentor Communications**

Faculty members and academic advisors at TUOS may express support for certain applicants based on their demonstrated interest in a field of study. However, all **formal admission decisions are made exclusively by the TUOS Office of Admissions**.

While faculty may express enthusiasm for a prospective student’s application, applicants should understand that only the Office of Admissions has the authority to extend official offers of admission. Any communication from faculty or department representatives does not constitute a binding commitment.
