We seek students with intellectual curiosity who have pursued and demonstrated academic excellence. TUOS also values applicants with strong personal and extracurricular accomplishments.

As you prepare your application, help us understand your talents, academic achievements, and personal journey. We'll ask for your transcript and recommendations, but we also want to know more than just statistics. Tell us your story. Show us what makes you unique. Tell us how you would take advantage of the academic and nonacademic opportunities at TUOS and contribute to our dynamic community. Above all, be authentic and let your voice shine through.

# **Courses**

We encourage applicants to complete coursework in key academic areas, including English, mathematics, scientific inquiry, and the humanities. (Full details can be found on the [Before You Apply](#) page.) TUOS values students who challenge themselves with advanced coursework such as honors, Advanced Placement (AP), dual-enrollment programs, or equivalent qualifications such as International Baccalaureate (IB) or A-Levels.

# **Essays**

As part of the application, we ask applicants to submit essays and short-answer responses. This is your opportunity to showcase your best writing and express your ideas in your own voice.

While seeking guidance from mentors, teachers, or counselors is encouraged, your essays must be entirely your own work. Intellectual integrity is a fundamental principle at TUOS. When submitting your application, you will be asked to certify that all responses, including essays, are your own. TUOS may revoke the admission of any student whose application materials are found to have been authored by another source, including essays obtained from external sources.

# **Our Advice**

Rather than focusing on meeting a rigid set of criteria, build an application that provides a clear picture of your achievements—both in and out of the classroom—so we can assess your potential and the unique contributions you would bring to TUOS. Show us what kind of student you are. Demonstrate how you have engaged with the academic opportunities available at your school and how you have excelled and contributed in your own way.

TUOS values students who make an impact in their schools and communities. Tell us about your leadership, interests, unique skills, and extracurricular involvements. If you've held a job or taken on significant responsibilities, share that with us. Many TUOS students excel academically while also dedicating their time and energy to meaningful endeavors beyond the classroom. We want to know what drives you, what commitments you have made, and how you have acted upon them.
