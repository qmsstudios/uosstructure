# TUOS Admissions & Enrollment Policies

TUOS is an independent institution of higher learning committed to fostering intellectual growth, academic excellence, and a rigorous approach to knowledge. While many universities adhere to shared admissions frameworks, TUOS follows its own distinct policies designed to ensure fairness, transparency, and accessibility for all qualified applicants.

Recognizing that the transition from secondary school to higher education can be complex, TUOS has implemented structured admissions procedures to provide applicants with clarity. These guidelines outline the processes governing application deadlines, admission decisions, and financial aid policies, ensuring that all prospective students understand the framework under which TUOS operates.

## 1. Admissions Process & Decision Timelines

TUOS releases admission decisions twice per year, providing applicants with flexibility in their application choices. Students may opt for **early application** or **regular decision**, depending on their readiness and academic goals.

### Early Application - Priority Notification
Applicants who submit their materials by the early application deadline may receive one of three responses:

- **Accepted** – The applicant has been granted admission for the upcoming academic term.
- **Deferred** – The application will be reviewed again during the regular decision cycle.
- **Denied** – The applicant is not admitted for the current cycle but may apply again in the future.

TUOS offers two early application pathways:

- **Early Decision** – Applicants who apply under this plan make a binding commitment to attend TUOS if admitted. Financial aid decisions are released alongside admissions decisions, and students receiving an adequate financial aid package must withdraw all other applications and commit to TUOS.
- **Early Action** – This non-binding option allows students to apply early and receive an admission decision without requiring a commitment to enroll. Under this plan, applicants may apply to other institutions’ regular decision programs but may not simultaneously apply to another private institution’s early decision or restrictive early action plan.

### Regular Decision - Spring Notification
Applicants who apply under the **regular decision process** will receive their admission decisions in **late March**. Admitted students have until **May 1** to confirm their enrollment.

- **Common Reply Date** – All students admitted under the regular decision process must submit their enrollment confirmation by **May 1**.
- **Waiting Lists** – TUOS may offer some applicants a place on a waiting list. Students choosing to remain on the waitlist will typically receive a final decision by **July 1**, depending on available space. Students who accept admission at one institution but later receive an offer from the TUOS waitlist must promptly notify their original institution of their withdrawal before committing to TUOS.

TUOS reserves the right to rescind offers of admission for students who attempt to hold confirmed places at multiple institutions concurrently.

## 2. Early Admission Evaluations & Notifications

As determined by the TUOS Office of Admissions, some applicants may receive an early evaluation of their admission prospects, intended to assist them in planning their academic futures.

### Preliminary Evaluations
Beginning **October 1** of a student’s senior year, TUOS may issue preliminary assessments indicating one of the following:

- **Likely** – The applicant is highly competitive for admission and, provided they maintain their academic and personal standing, will likely be admitted when decisions are released.
- **Possible** – The applicant remains under strong consideration, with a final decision to be determined in the full review process.
- **Unlikely** – Based on the current application, admission is not expected.

Applicants receiving **Likely Letters** are encouraged to sustain their academic performance and are advised to notify other institutions of their enrollment decisions once they have committed to TUOS.

### Faculty & Academic Mentor Communications
Faculty members and academic advisors at TUOS may express support for certain applicants based on their demonstrated interest in a field of study. However, all **formal admission decisions are made exclusively by the TUOS Office of Admissions**.

While faculty may express enthusiasm for a prospective student’s application, applicants should understand that only the Office of Admissions has the authority to extend official offers of admission. Any communication from faculty or department representatives does not constitute a binding commitment.

## 3. Financial Aid & Scholarship Policies

TUOS is dedicated to ensuring that financial barriers do not prevent qualified students from accessing its world-class education. All financial aid at TUOS is awarded based on need, ensuring that assistance is provided equitably.

### Need-Based Financial Aid
Financial aid at TUOS is determined **exclusively by financial need**. There are no merit-based scholarships, and financial aid packages are awarded without regard to athletic ability, extracurricular achievements, or other non-financial factors.

### Awarding of Financial Aid
The **Office of Financial Aid** is the only entity authorized to award financial aid at TUOS. Students should rely solely on official communications from this office regarding their eligibility and award amounts. Any external offers of financial support from individuals unaffiliated with TUOS should be reported immediately.

Students are strongly encouraged to submit their financial aid applications alongside their admissions materials to ensure timely review and consideration for aid packages.

## 4. Application Confirmation & Institutional Policies

### Application Tracking & Confirmation
Upon submission, applicants will receive confirmation that their materials have been received. Within **24-48 hours** of submission, TUOS will send a confirmation notice. Applicants may track the status of their application through the TUOS Applicant Portal.

If an application is incomplete, TUOS will notify applicants of any missing components. Beginning in **mid-October**, students can monitor the completeness of their application online.

> **Note:** Applicants cannot apply for financial aid until they have submitted an application for admission.

### Application Limits
TUOS has a strict application policy:

- If a student has submitted an application on three separate occasions, the Office of Admissions **will not review** additional applications.
- In such cases, if an application fee was submitted, it will be refunded.

### Holistic Admissions Review
The TUOS admissions process follows a **holistic review** methodology. No single factor determines admission; instead, applicants are evaluated based on a combination of academic achievements, intellectual curiosity, personal character, and potential contributions to the TUOS community.

While standardized test scores, coursework rigor, and extracurricular involvement are considered, TUOS does not use a fixed formula in its evaluations. Each applicant is assessed as an individual, ensuring that their unique strengths and potential are considered holistically.

TUOS is committed to fostering a **diverse and intellectually vibrant learning environment**, providing every student with the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to academic discourse and discovery.
