# TUOS Admissions Approach  

For each class, TUOS brings together a dynamic mix of intellectually driven students from diverse backgrounds to foster an environment of discovery and innovation.  

We value not only academic excellence but also the personal experiences, skills, and aspirations that make each student unique. As you prepare your application, we encourage you to showcase your talents, academic journey, and accomplishments both inside and outside the classroom.  

We will review your transcript and recommendations, but we also want to understand more than just the numbers. Tell us your story. Show us your potential. Explain how you will take advantage of the academic and extracurricular opportunities at TUOS and contribute to our learning community.  

# **Preparing for TUOS**  

We seek students who are driven by intellectual curiosity, committed to academic excellence, and engaged in meaningful personal and extracurricular pursuits. Our admissions process is designed to identify individuals who will contribute to and benefit from the vibrant academic community at TUOS.

> **Recommended Course of Study**  
> TUOS encourages students to challenge themselves with rigorous coursework that strengthens their analytical, scientific, and interdisciplinary thinking skills. We recommend a balanced curriculum that includes advanced courses in mathematics, science, humanities, and social sciences. Participation in honors, Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), or other advanced programs is highly valued.

> **Application Tips**  
> Be authentic in your application and let your unique perspective stand out. Carefully review the TUOS application process to ensure all materials are submitted on time. Highlight your achievements, experiences, and the challenges you have overcome. Use your personal statement to provide insight into your character, motivations, and goals. Seek feedback from teachers, mentors, or counselors to refine your application.

> [**Standardized Testing Policy**](#)  
> TUOS follows a flexible approach to standardized testing requirements, emphasizing a holistic review process. While standardized test scores can provide useful information about a student's academic abilities, they are only one part of the application. We consider the context of each applicant's educational background and opportunities. Students may choose to submit SAT, ACT, or other standardized test scores if they believe it will enhance their application.

> [**TUOS-Specific Application Questions**](#)  
> Applicants are required to answer a set of TUOS-specific questions to help us understand their academic and personal aspirations. These questions are designed to give us a deeper insight into your interests, values, and how you envision contributing to the TUOS community. Take your time to thoughtfully respond to each question, providing specific examples and reflections.

> [**Fee Waiver**](#)  
> TUOS offers fee waivers to students who meet eligibility criteria, ensuring that financial constraints do not hinder access to education. If the application fee presents a financial hardship, we encourage you to apply for a fee waiver. Detailed information on eligibility and the application process for fee waivers is available on our admissions website.
