The Doctor of Philosophy in Consciousness Studies is an advanced research program dedicated to exploring the fundamental nature of awareness, self-reflection, and higher-order cognition. This program is designed for scholars seeking to integrate neuroscience, transpersonal psychology, quantum consciousness, and computational models of self-awareness to develop new frameworks for understanding subjective experience, perception structuring, and consciousness evolution.

**About the Program**

The Ph.D. in Consciousness Studies provides an interdisciplinary research foundation for investigating the complex nature of consciousness, blending cognitive neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, and quantum theory. Students will explore various models of awareness, including neural correlates of consciousness, transpersonal states, and non-local cognition, applying these insights to self-awareness modeling in both human and artificial intelligence systems.

This program emphasizes the development of theoretical and applied models for consciousness evolution, perception structuring, and altered states of awareness. Through advanced coursework, independent research, and experimental methodologies, students will gain expertise in the study of consciousness from multiple perspectives, preparing them for leadership roles in consciousness research and related fields.

**Key Areas of Study**

•	Neuroscientific and Cognitive Foundations of Awareness

•	Transpersonal Psychology and Consciousness Expansion

•	Quantum Consciousness and Non-Local Cognition

•	Computational Models of Self-Awareness and AI Consciousness

**Career Pathways**

Graduates of the Ph.D. in Consciousness Studies will be prepared for careers in consciousness research, AI-driven self-awareness modeling, cognitive science, and transpersonal psychology. This program equips students to contribute to cutting-edge advancements in consciousness theory, AI cognition, and interdisciplinary research on human and artificial awareness.
