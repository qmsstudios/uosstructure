The Doctor of Philosophy in Epistemology is an advanced research program dedicated to exploring theories of knowledge, justification, belief structures, and computational epistemology. This program is designed for scholars seeking to develop rigorous frameworks for understanding the nature of knowledge and decision-making, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence and cognitive systems.

**About the Program**

The Ph.D. in Epistemology provides a deep theoretical and applied foundation in knowledge structures, integrating formal logic, AI-driven epistemic modeling, and cognitive science. Students will critically analyze historical and contemporary epistemic theories while engaging in cutting-edge research on knowledge representation, inference systems, and computational models of reasoning.

Through a combination of coursework, research, and dissertation work, students will investigate how epistemic principles shape intelligent systems, human cognition, and AI-driven decision-making models. This interdisciplinary approach equips graduates with the expertise to contribute to advancements in AI knowledge engineering, cognitive decision science, and philosophical research on epistemic structures.

**Key Areas of Study**

•	Theories of Knowledge, Justification, and Belief Systems

•	Formal Logic and Computational Epistemology

•	AI-Driven Epistemic Modeling and Knowledge Representation

•	Cognitive Decision Science and Rational Inference Systems

**Career Pathways**

Graduates of the Ph.D. in Epistemology are prepared for careers in AI-driven knowledge engineering, epistemic modeling, cognitive decision science, and philosophical research. They will be equipped to lead research initiatives in academic institutions, artificial intelligence development, and interdisciplinary projects focused on advancing the understanding of knowledge structures and reasoning systems.
