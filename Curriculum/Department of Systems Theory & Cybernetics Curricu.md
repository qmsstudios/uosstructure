This curriculum for the Department of Systems Theory & Cybernetics at UOS reflects the department's focus on the study of complex systems, feedback processes, and control mechanisms across various domains. The courses progress from foundational concepts to specialized topics that explore the behavior and organization of both natural and artificial systems.

The curriculum balances theoretical principles with practical applications, providing students with both conceptual frameworks for understanding systems and hands-on skills in systems modeling and analysis. Students develop expertise in systems thinking while investigating cybernetic principles in biological, social, cognitive, and technological contexts.

As students advance through the program, they encounter increasingly sophisticated approaches to systems science, from basic feedback loops to complex questions about self-organization, emergence, chaos theory, and the cybernetic dimensions of consciousness and cognition.

The doctoral-level courses emphasize original research contributions that advance our understanding of complex systems and cybernetic processes, preparing students to become thought leaders who can apply systems perspectives to address complex interdisciplinary challenges.

The department's integration with the university's broader focus on ontological science is particularly evident in upper-level courses that explore systems ontology, reality modeling, and the philosophical foundations of systems theory - examining how complex systems shape and reflect the fundamental nature of reality.
