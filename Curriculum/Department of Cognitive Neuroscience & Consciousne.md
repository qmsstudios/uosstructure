This curriculum for the Department of Cognitive Neuroscience & Consciousness Studies at UOS reflects the department's focus on bridging neuroscientific approaches with consciousness research. The courses progress from foundational concepts to specialized topics that explore the neural basis of conscious experience and cognitive processes.

The curriculum balances empirical methodologies with theoretical frameworks, providing students with both research skills and conceptual tools for understanding the relationship between brain activity and conscious awareness. Students develop expertise in neuroscientific techniques while investigating philosophical questions about the nature of consciousness.

As students advance through the program, they encounter increasingly sophisticated approaches to mind-brain research, from basic neural correlates to complex questions about self-awareness, altered states of consciousness, and the "hard problem" of how physical brain processes give rise to subjective experience.

The doctoral-level courses emphasize original research contributions that advance our understanding of consciousness and cognition, preparing students to become thought leaders at the intersection of neuroscience, philosophy, and consciousness studies.

The department's integration with the university's broader focus on ontological science is particularly evident in upper-level courses that explore consciousness in relation to reality, transcendent experiences, and fundamental questions about the nature of awareness and its place in the universe.
