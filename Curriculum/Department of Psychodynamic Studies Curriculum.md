This curriculum reflects the department's integration of classical psychodynamic theory with cognitive science, transpersonal psychology, and philosophical inquiry. The courses progress from foundational concepts to specialized advanced topics, with increasing emphasis on research methodologies and integration across disciplines as students advance.

The curriculum balances theoretical knowledge with practical applications and research skills, while incorporating both Western and cross-cultural perspectives on the unconscious mind. The doctoral-level courses emphasize original research contributions to the field and deeper integration of psychodynamic theory with other domains of knowledge.
