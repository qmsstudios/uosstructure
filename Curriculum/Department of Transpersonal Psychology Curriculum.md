This curriculum for the Department of Transpersonal Psychology at UOS reflects the department's focus on exploring human consciousness beyond conventional psychological models. The courses progress from foundational concepts to specialized topics that examine the integration of mind, body, and spirit.

The curriculum balances theoretical frameworks with experiential practices, providing students with both academic knowledge and personal exploration opportunities. Students develop expertise in transpersonal psychology while investigating higher states of awareness, personal transformation, and the interconnected nature of reality.

As students advance through the program, they encounter increasingly sophisticated approaches to consciousness studies, from basic psychological models to complex questions about exceptional human experiences, non-ordinary states of consciousness, and the relationship between consciousness and reality.

The doctoral-level courses emphasize original research contributions that advance our understanding of transpersonal psychology, preparing students to become thought leaders who can apply these insights to address complex questions about human potential, consciousness expansion, and the frontiers of psychological science.

The department's integration with the university's broader focus on ontological science is particularly evident in upper-level courses that explore the nature of reality, non-dual awareness, and the philosophical foundations of consciousness studies.
