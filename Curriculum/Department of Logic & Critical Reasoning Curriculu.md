# Department of Logic & Critical Reasoning Curriculum

This curriculum for the Department of Logic & Critical Reasoning at UOS reflects the department's focus on the systematic study of formal logic, structured reasoning, and epistemic justification. The courses progress from foundational concepts to specialized topics that explore the nuances of logical systems and reasoning processes.
The curriculum balances theoretical frameworks with practical applications, providing students with both abstract logical tools and concrete reasoning skills. Students develop expertise in formal systems while exploring the philosophical, cognitive, and computational aspects of logical thinking.
As students advance through the program, they encounter increasingly sophisticated logical systems and reasoning methodologies, from basic propositional logic to complex non-classical logics, modal systems, and advanced decision theory.
The doctoral-level courses emphasize original research contributions that advance our understanding of logical systems, reasoning processes, and their applications in philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and cognitive science.
The department's interdisciplinary approach allows students to examine reasoning from multiple perspectives, including formal, philosophical, cognitive, and computational, preparing them to address complex problems of knowledge, justification, and rational thought.
