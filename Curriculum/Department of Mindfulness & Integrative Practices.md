This curriculum for the Department of Mindfulness & Integrative Practices at UOS reflects the department's focus on blending ancient contemplative traditions with modern cognitive science and holistic wellness approaches. The courses progress from foundational concepts to specialized applications of mindfulness and embodied practices.

The curriculum balances theoretical knowledge with experiential learning and research methodology, providing students with both intellectual understanding and practical skills in mindfulness and integrative practices. Students develop expertise in cognitive enhancement techniques while exploring the physiological, neurological, and psychological dimensions of contemplative practices.

As students advance through the program, they encounter increasingly sophisticated approaches to mindfulness, from basic meditation techniques to complex applications in fields like education, leadership, healthcare, and social transformation.
