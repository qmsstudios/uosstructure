This curriculum for the School of Ethical Studies at UOS reflects the department's focus on moral philosophy, ethical decision-making, and the development of cultural and emotional intelligence. The courses progress from foundational concepts to specialized topics that examine ethical challenges in various contexts.

The curriculum balances theoretical frameworks with practical applications, providing students with both conceptual tools for understanding ethics and practical skills for addressing moral dilemmas. Students develop expertise in ethical theory while exploring cultural intelligence, emotional intelligence, and adaptive intelligence in a rapidly evolving world.

As students advance through the program, they encounter increasingly sophisticated approaches to ethical questions, from basic moral theories to complex ethical issues in technology, healthcare, business, and international relations. The curriculum emphasizes the development of ethical reasoning capacities that can adapt to changing cultural and technological contexts.

The doctoral-level courses emphasize original research contributions that advance our understanding of ethics in relation to consciousness, reality frameworks, and human enhancement, preparing students to become thought leaders who can address emerging ethical challenges in a thoughtful and nuanced manner.

The school's integration with the university's broader focus on ontological science is particularly evident in upper-level courses that explore the relationship between ethics and ontological frameworks, consciousness transformation, and the philosophical foundations of moral systems.
