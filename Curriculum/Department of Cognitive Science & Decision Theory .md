This curriculum for the Department of Cognitive Science & Decision Theory at UOS reflects the department's focus on the exploration of cognition, intelligence, and decision-making mechanisms. The courses progress from foundational concepts to specialized topics that examine the processes underlying thought, reasoning, and perception.

The curriculum balances theoretical approaches with experimental and computational methodologies, providing students with both conceptual frameworks and practical skills for studying cognitive systems. Students develop expertise in cognitive science while exploring decision theory and the emerging field of quantum cognition.

As students advance through the program, they encounter increasingly sophisticated approaches to understanding the mind, from basic perceptual processes to complex questions about rationality, judgment under uncertainty, and the quantum-like nature of certain cognitive phenomena.

The doctoral-level courses emphasize original research contributions that advance our understanding of cognitive science and decision theory, preparing students to become thought leaders who can apply these insights to address complex problems in artificial intelligence, behavioral economics, and cognitive modeling.

The department's integration with the university's broader focus on ontological science is particularly evident in upper-level courses that explore cognitive ontology, reality modeling, and the philosophical foundations of mind and cognition.
