This curriculum for the Department of Theocentric Studies at UOS reflects the department's focus on blending philosophical exploration with theological methodologies. The courses progress from foundational concepts to specialized topics that examine divine philosophy, transcendent epistemology, and spiritual cognition.

The curriculum balances classical and modern theocentric perspectives, providing students with a structured yet broad approach to understanding the divine, consciousness, and metaphysical structures of spiritual existence. Students develop skills in rigorous philosophical analysis while engaging with diverse theological traditions.

As students advance through the program, they encounter increasingly sophisticated approaches to theocentric questions, from basic principles to complex philosophical problems about divine nature, transcendence, and the relationship between divine reality and human cognition.

The doctoral-level courses emphasize original research contributions that advance theocentric studies, preparing students to become thought leaders who can bridge traditional theological approaches with contemporary philosophical methodologies and consciousness studies.
