## **Core Courses (24 credits):**

1. ### **DET 501 – Foundations of Decision Theory**

Introduction to the fundamental concepts of decision theory, focusing on rational choice, utility theory, and decision-making under uncertainty. This course covers the historical development of decision theory, key theoretical frameworks, and practical applications. Students will learn to model decision problems and evaluate different decision-making strategies.

2. ### **DET 502 – Game Theory and Strategic Decision-Making**

Exploration of game theory principles and their applications in strategic decision-making, negotiation, and competitive environments. Topics include Nash equilibrium, dominant strategies, mixed strategies, and repeated games. Students will analyze real-world scenarios and develop strategies for optimal decision-making in competitive contexts.

3. ### **DET 503 – Behavioral Decision Theory**

Study of how psychological and cognitive factors influence decision-making. Emphasis on heuristics, biases, and deviations from rational models. The course examines the impact of cognitive limitations, emotions, and social influences on decision-making processes. Students will explore experimental findings and theoretical models from behavioral economics and psychology.

4. ### **DET 504 – Probabilistic Reasoning and Bayesian Networks**

Examination of probabilistic reasoning in decision-making processes, with a focus on Bayesian networks and probabilistic models of inference. Students will learn to construct and interpret Bayesian networks, perform probabilistic inference, and apply these techniques to real-world decision problems. The course also covers the principles of Bayesian statistics and their applications in decision theory.

5. ### **DET 505 – Decision Analysis and Risk Management**

Application of decision analysis methods to risk management. Topics include multi-criteria decision analysis, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty modeling. Students will learn to identify, assess, and manage risks in various decision-making contexts. The course includes case studies and practical exercises to develop skills in applying decision analysis tools and techniques.

6. ### **DET 506 – Ethical Decision-Making in Complex Systems**

Analysis of ethical considerations in decision-making across complex systems. Emphasis on moral frameworks, values-based decision-making, and ethical dilemmas in technology and policy. Students will explore ethical theories, stakeholder analysis, and the role of ethics in organizational and societal decision-making. The course includes discussions on contemporary ethical issues and case studies.

7. ### **DET 699 – Capstone Research in Decision Theory**

A culminating research project where students apply decision theory to a practical or theoretical problem. The capstone involves producing a comprehensive thesis. Students will conduct independent research under faculty supervision, develop a research proposal, collect and analyze data, and present their findings. The course emphasizes the integration of theoretical knowledge and practical skills in decision theory.
