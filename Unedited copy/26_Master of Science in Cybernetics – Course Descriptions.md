## **Core Courses (24 credits):**

1. ### **CYB 501 – Foundations of Cybernetics**

Introduction to the core principles of cybernetics, focusing on feedback loops, self-regulation, and system dynamics in biological and technological systems. Students will explore historical and contemporary perspectives on cybernetics and its foundational concepts, including circular causality and information theory.

2. ### **CYB 502 – Systems Theory and Complexity**

Study of systems theory and complexity science, with an emphasis on emergent phenomena, nonlinear dynamics, and adaptive systems. The course covers key topics such as chaos theory, fractals, and the behavior of complex adaptive systems in various contexts, from ecosystems to social organizations.

3. ### **CYB 503 – Human-Machine Systems and Control**

Examination of human-machine interactions and control systems. Focus on automation, human-in-the-loop systems, and cognitive control. Students will learn about the design and analysis of control systems, human factors engineering, and the integration of human and machine intelligence in collaborative environments.

4. ### **CYB 504 – Cybernetic Models in Biological Systems**

Exploration of cybernetic principles in biological systems, including homeostasis, neural regulation, and biofeedback. The course delves into the application of cybernetic models to understand physiological processes, neural networks, and the regulatory mechanisms that maintain stability and adaptability in living organisms.

5. ### **CYB 505 – Applied Cybernetics in Technology and Society**

Study of the application of cybernetic concepts in technology and social systems. Topics include governance, societal feedback loops, and cyber-physical systems. Students will analyze case studies on the impact of cybernetics on technological innovation, policy-making, and the management of complex societal issues.

6. ### **CYB 506 – Self-Organizing Systems and Autonomy**

Investigation of self-organizing systems and autonomous behavior in natural and artificial systems. The course covers principles of self-organization, swarm intelligence, and the development of autonomous agents. Students will explore applications in robotics, artificial intelligence, and decentralized systems.

7. ### **CYB 699 – Capstone Research in Cybernetics**

A comprehensive research project integrating cybernetic theory and application. Students produce a thesis addressing a specific challenge in the field of cybernetics. The capstone project involves independent research, data analysis, and the presentation of findings, demonstrating the student's ability to apply cybernetic principles to real-world problems.
