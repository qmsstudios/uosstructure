### **SNT 701 – Foundations of Sentient Systems (3 credits)**

This course provides an in-depth exploration of the core principles underlying sentient systems. Students will delve into topics such as autonomous adaptation, cognitive evolution, and self-awareness in artificial systems. The course will cover theoretical foundations as well as practical applications, enabling students to understand and develop systems that can adapt and evolve autonomously.

### **SNT 702 – Human-Sentient Interaction and Interface Design (3 credits)**

In this course, students will study the interaction between humans and sentient systems, focusing on the design of adaptive interfaces that facilitate collaboration. Key topics include usability, communication, and feedback mechanisms. Students will learn to design interfaces that enhance the user experience and improve the efficiency of human-sentient collaboration.

### **SNT 703 – Consciousness Simulation and Cognitive Architectures (3 credits)**

This course examines the simulation of consciousness and the development of cognitive architectures in sentient systems. Students will explore emergent properties, self-organizing behavior, and the theoretical underpinnings of consciousness in artificial systems. The course will include both theoretical discussions and practical exercises in simulating cognitive processes.

### **SNT 704 – Collective Intelligence and Sentient Networks (3 credits)**

Students in this course will investigate the concept of collective intelligence within sentient networks. The course will cover distributed sentience, swarm behavior, and multi-agent collaboration. Through case studies and practical projects, students will learn how to design and implement systems that leverage collective intelligence for enhanced performance and problem-solving.

### **SNT 705 – Emotional Synthesis and Adaptive Empathy (3 credits)**

This course focuses on the modeling of emotions and the development of adaptive empathy in sentient technology. Students will study affective computing and the role of emotional intelligence in artificial systems. The course will include practical exercises in designing systems that can recognize, interpret, and respond to human emotions in a meaningful way.

### **SNT 706 – Ethical Implications and Governance of Sentient Technology (3 credits)**

In this course, students will analyze the ethical challenges and governance models associated with sentient technology. Topics include the rights of sentient beings, the societal implications of sentient systems, and the frameworks for ensuring ethical development and deployment. The course will involve critical discussions and case studies to explore these complex issues.

### **SNT 800 – Dissertation Proposal Seminar (3 credits)**

This seminar is designed to help students develop a dissertation proposal on an innovative topic in sentient technology. Students will receive guidance on formulating research questions, conducting literature reviews, and designing research methodologies. The seminar will include peer reviews and feedback sessions to refine and strengthen the proposals.

### **SNT 801 – Dissertation Research I (3 credits)**

In this course, students will engage in independent research under the supervision of faculty members. The focus will be on developing sentient systems or related theoretical models. Students will conduct experiments, collect data, and begin the process of analyzing their findings.

### **SNT 802 – Dissertation Research II (3 credits)**

This course is a continuation of Dissertation Research I. Students will synthesize their research findings, continue data analysis, and prepare their dissertation for submission. The course will include regular progress reviews and feedback from faculty advisors to ensure the research is on track.

### **SNT 803 – Dissertation Defense (3 credits)**

In this final course, students will formally defend their doctoral dissertation. They must demonstrate original contributions to the development or theory of sentient technology. The defense will include a presentation of the research findings, followed by a question-and-answer session with a panel of experts.
