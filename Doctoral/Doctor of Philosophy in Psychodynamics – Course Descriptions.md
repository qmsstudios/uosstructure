## **Core Courses (18 credits):**

1. ### **PSY 701 – Foundations of Advanced Psychodynamic Theory**

This course provides an in-depth exploration of advanced psychodynamic concepts. Students will delve into the intricacies of unconscious processes, defense mechanisms, and the modern adaptations of classical psychodynamic theories. The course aims to build a robust theoretical foundation that will support advanced clinical practice and research in psychodynamics.

2. ### **PSY 702 – Contemporary Approaches in Psychodynamics**

In this course, students will study contemporary psychodynamic frameworks, including object relations theory, self-psychology, and relational psychoanalysis. The course will cover the evolution of these theories and their application in modern psychodynamic practice. Students will critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of each approach and explore their relevance to current clinical issues.

3. ### **PSY 703 – Cognitive Psychodynamics and Mental Structures**

This course examines cognitive psychodynamic models that integrate traditional psychodynamic theories with findings from cognitive science and neuroscience. Students will explore how mental structures and cognitive processes influence psychodynamic phenomena. The course will cover topics such as memory, perception, and the interplay between conscious and unconscious processes.

4. ### **PSY 704 – Psychodynamics of Emotional and Behavioral Regulation**

In this course, students will analyze emotional regulation and behavioral patterns through a psychodynamic lens. The focus will be on understanding the unconscious influences on emotional processes and how these affect behavior. The course will cover various psychodynamic theories related to emotional regulation and provide practical insights into therapeutic interventions.

5. ### **PSY 705 – Trauma, Attachment, and Psychodynamic Healing**

This course focuses on the study of trauma and attachment theory from a psychodynamic perspective. Students will examine the impact of early attachment experiences on psychological development and the role of trauma in shaping mental health. The course will emphasize therapeutic approaches to trauma recovery and developmental repair, integrating psychodynamic principles with contemporary trauma-informed practices.

6. ### **PSY 706 – Applied Psychodynamics in Clinical and Organizational Settings**

This course explores the practical application of psychodynamic principles in both clinical and organizational environments. Students will learn about leadership dynamics, team cohesion, and unconscious group processes. The course will provide tools for applying psychodynamic concepts to enhance organizational effectiveness and address clinical challenges in various settings.

## **Research & Dissertation (12 Credits)**

1. ### **PSY 800 – Dissertation Proposal Seminar** (3 credits)

In this seminar, students will develop a dissertation proposal focusing on a psychodynamic topic of their choice. The course will guide students through the process of formulating research questions, conducting literature reviews, and designing a research methodology. By the end of the seminar, students will have a well-developed proposal ready for approval.

2. ### **PSY 801 – Dissertation Research I** (3 credits)

This course involves independent research under faculty supervision, focusing on a theoretical or applied psychodynamic topic. Students will begin collecting data, analyzing results, and refining their research questions. The course aims to support students in making significant progress on their dissertation projects.

3. ### **PSY 802 – Dissertation Research II** (3 credits)

A continuation of Dissertation Research I, this course allows students to further their research efforts, integrate their findings, and refine their dissertation. Students will receive ongoing support and feedback from faculty advisors to ensure the quality and rigor of their research.

4. ### **PSY 803 – Dissertation Defense** (3 credits)

In this course, students will prepare for and conduct the formal defense of their doctoral dissertation. The defense will involve presenting their research findings to a committee of faculty members and demonstrating their original contribution to the field of psychodynamics. Successful completion of the defense is required for the awarding of the doctoral degree.
