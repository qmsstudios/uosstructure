## **Core Courses (18 credits):**

1. ### **DET 701 – Advanced Decision Theory**

    This course provides a comprehensive study of advanced decision theory. Students will delve into the principles of rational choice, utility theory, and decision-making under uncertainty. The course will cover various models and approaches to decision-making, equipping students with the skills to analyze and solve complex decision problems.

2. ### **DET 702 – Game Theory and Strategic Decision Models**

    In this course, students will examine the fundamentals of game theory and its application in strategic decision-making. Topics include Nash equilibria, cooperative strategies, and competitive dynamics. The course will emphasize the use of game theory in real-world scenarios, helping students develop strategic thinking and problem-solving skills.

3. ### **DET 703 – Behavioral Decision Science**

    This course explores the psychological and cognitive factors that influence decision-making. Students will study heuristics, biases, and prospect theory, gaining insights into how people make decisions in uncertain and complex environments. The course will also cover methods for improving decision-making processes by understanding human behavior.

4. ### **DET 704 – Probabilistic Models and Bayesian Decision-Making**

    Students in this course will explore probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian networks in decision-making processes. The course focuses on uncertainty modeling and adaptive decision support, providing students with the tools to make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty. Practical applications of Bayesian decision-making will be emphasized.

5. ### **DET 705 – Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis and Optimization**

    This course investigates multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques and their use in optimizing complex decisions across multiple domains. Students will learn to apply MCDA methods to evaluate and prioritize different options, considering various criteria and trade-offs. The course will include case studies and practical exercises to enhance learning.

6. ### **DET 706 – Ethics and Decision-Making in Complex Systems**

    This course focuses on ethical decision-making frameworks in complex systems. Topics include algorithmic fairness, moral dilemmas, and values-based decision analysis. Students will explore the ethical implications of decision-making in various contexts and develop the ability to make ethically sound decisions in complex situations.

## **Research & Dissertation (12 Credits)**

1. ### **DET 800 – Dissertation Proposal Seminar** (3 credits)

    In this seminar, students will develop a dissertation proposal focusing on a specific topic in decision theory. The course will guide students through the process of identifying research questions, conducting literature reviews, and designing research methodologies. By the end of the seminar, students will have a well-defined proposal ready for approval.

2. ### **DET 801 – Dissertation Research I** (3 credits)

    This course involves independent research under faculty supervision, focusing on theoretical or applied aspects of decision theory. Students will conduct original research, collect and analyze data, and begin drafting their dissertation. Regular meetings with faculty advisors will ensure progress and provide guidance.

3. ### **DET 802 – Dissertation Research II** (3 credits)

    A continuation of Dissertation Research I, this course allows students to integrate their findings and prepare their dissertation for submission. Students will refine their research, address feedback, and finalize their dissertation chapters. The course emphasizes the importance of rigorous research and clear, concise writing.

4. ### **DET 803 – Dissertation Defense** (3 credits)

    In this course, students will formally present and defend their dissertation. The defense will involve a comprehensive presentation of the research, followed by a question-and-answer session with a panel of experts. Students must demonstrate original contributions to the field of decision theory and defend their methodologies and conclusions.
