**Day of FPO**

- **Defend Your Dissertation!**

### Following the FPO

After a successful defense, Ph.D. students must submit the required forms to be included on the upcoming degree list. These forms must be submitted no later than two weeks following the defense or by the degree deadline, whichever comes first. Forms are accessed through the UOS Graduation Portal. Confirmation emails will be sent for each form upon approval.

**Checkout Form**

- Complete all required fields and review all information carefully.
- **Note:** Once your checkout form is submitted, you will lose access to certain university resources, including library privileges. Submit this form only after all necessary access is no longer needed.

**Final Paperwork Form**

- Submit a PDF of your dissertation to the UOS Digital Repository.
- Complete the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and attach the "Certificate of Completion" page.
- Complete the UOS Graduate Exit Questionnaire and attach the "Confirmation of Completion" page.
- If a verification letter is required before receiving your diploma, request it on the final paperwork form.

### Enrollment and Benefits Following the FPO

Enrollment typically ends on the first day of the month following the FPO. Please review the timeline for enrollment and benefits to understand changes.

If you are serving as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) during the semester of your defense, consult with your department to ensure that your FPO date allows continued eligibility through the end of the term. Enrollment continues only through the end of the month in which the FPO is held. Exceptions must be discussed with the UOS Office of Graduate Affairs.

### Bound Dissertation Copies

Most Ph.D. students at UOS are not required to submit printed bound copies of their dissertation. However, students who have removed content from the digital version to avoid copyright infringement must submit an unredacted, bound version to the UOS Library according to the Dissertation Formatting Guidelines. Deliver the bound copy by hand, mail, or delivery service to the following address:

Attn: Dissertations, University of Ontological Science Library, 100 Knowledge Way, Tempe, AZ 85281.
