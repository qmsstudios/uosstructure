### Ph.D. Programs Overview

### Coursework

Doctoral students complete most core coursework during the first year, with additional required courses depending on their specialization. Detailed course requirements for each department are provided in the Course Requirements section.

### Teaching Experience

Teaching experience is an integral part of graduate education at UOS. Each student must complete a minimum of **9 teaching assistant hours** (equivalent to approximately 10 hours per week for three semesters). Students often exceed this requirement over five years of regular enrollment and must teach during semesters when fellowship or research grants are not available.

### Generals and Dissertation Requirements

- **Comprehensive Exam:** Conducted in the third year, typically in late September or early October. Research and theoretical papers must be submitted to the committee at least two weeks prior to the exam date.
- **Dissertation Proposal:** Proposal meetings are held in the fourth year during the fall or winter semester. Proposals must be submitted at least two weeks ahead of the scheduled meeting.
- **Dissertation Draft:** A complete draft is due by **March 1 of the fifth year**. The final dissertation must be submitted by **April 1**.
- **Final Defense:** The Final Oral Defense takes place at the end of the fifth year. This public presentation allows the candidate to defend their dissertation.

### Committees

- **Comprehensive Exam and Dissertation Proposal Committee:** Consists of the primary advisor and two faculty members. At least one committee member must be from a different academic discipline to provide a broader perspective.
- **Dissertation Reading Committee:** Advisor and two faculty members, with one out-of-area faculty member to ensure diverse academic input.
- **Final Defense Committee:** Includes the advisor and two faculty members not on the Dissertation Reading Committee, with one out-of-area member.

"Out-of-area" is broadly defined as a faculty member who offers expertise outside the candidate’s primary field of study, enriching the academic scope of the committee.

Our degree programs are designed to bridge traditional academic disciplines and innovative fields such as quantum cognition, computational ontology, and transpersonal psychology. As part of the UOS graduate experience, students can pursue interdisciplinary study tracks, research collaborations, and unique programs that explore the boundaries of emerging knowledge systems.
