# Final Master's Degree Requirements

### Preparing for Graduation

Final master’s degree students at the University of Ontological Science (UOS) who have completed their programs and are eligible to graduate must complete two essential processes. The first is the **Advanced Degree Application Process**, followed by the **Checkout Process**, which includes submitting the Checkout Form and Final Paperwork Form. Students must complete these steps to be awarded their final master’s degree (e.g., M.Sc. Ontology, M.Sc. Quantum Cognition, M.Sc. Epistemology, etc.).

### Advanced Degree Application Process

Final master’s degree students should stay in close contact with their department to confirm internal deadlines. Generally, two months before the degree deadline, students must begin the advanced degree application through the **UOS Graduate Portal**. Ensure that all information in the application is accurate, particularly regarding program details and expected completion dates.

Students will receive an email from the UOS Graduate Office confirming that their application has been received and advising them to proceed with the **Checkout Process**.

### Checkout Process

Both the **Checkout Form** and **Final Paperwork Form** are accessed through the **UOS Graduate Portal** and must be completed two weeks before the degree deadline. Before submitting these forms, final master’s students must follow these steps:

### Checkout Form

- Complete all required fields and carefully review the information for accuracy.
- **Note:** Once the Checkout Form is submitted, students will lose library access and certain campus privileges. Submit this form only when library resources are no longer needed.

### Final Paperwork Form

- **Complete the UOS Graduate Exit Survey:** Attach the electronic copy of the "Confirmation of Completion" page to your final paperwork.
- **Thesis Submission (for applicable programs):** Submit a PDF of your thesis to the UOS Digital Repository. Ensure it meets the university's formatting requirements.

After submitting the Checkout and Final Paperwork forms, and once they are reviewed and approved by the UOS Graduate Office, students will receive an email confirmation indicating the official degree date on which their name will be listed.
