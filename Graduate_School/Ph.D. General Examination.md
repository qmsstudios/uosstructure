# Ph.D. General Examination

The general examination at the University of Ontological Science (UOS) is designed to evaluate a student's comprehensive knowledge of their field, mastery of research methodologies, and ability to synthesize and present complex material. Performance on this examination, assessed by UOS faculty, determines the student’s readiness for dissertation research and further academic progression.

### Exam Format

The general examination is a core component of each department’s Ph.D. program at UOS. It may consist of multiple sections, with some parts testing comprehension of the field and others assessing the student’s potential for original research. The exam is not limited to material covered in coursework and may include written, oral, or a combination of both formats, depending on the department’s requirements.

### Timing

Each department at UOS determines the timing and structure of the general examination. Departments may administer the examination within a 10-day window during one of three official examination periods. With Graduate School approval, exams may be administered in multiple sessions across different periods, provided the final grade reflects cumulative performance.

The official examination periods for the academic year 2024–2025 are as follows:

- **September 23 – October 11, 2024**
- **January 13 – January 31, 2025**
- **April 14 – May 16, 2025**

Departments are not required to offer examinations during all three periods. Exceptions for examinations outside these periods may be granted only with approval from the Graduate School.

### Examination Committee

The general examination committee at UOS must consist of three or more faculty members with the rank of assistant professor or higher. At least two committee members must be UOS faculty, while external examiners must hold comparable academic standing in the scholarly community. Any external examiner requires prior approval from the Graduate School.

### Possible Outcomes

The outcome of the general examination determines whether the student advances to Ph.D. candidacy. Possible outcomes include:

- **Pass and move to doctoral candidacy:** The student advances to Ph.D. candidacy and becomes eligible to apply for the incidental master’s degree if not previously awarded.
- **Pass and do not move on to candidacy:** Students may receive the incidental master’s degree if all other pre-generals requirements are met.
- **Fail with option to retake:** Students who fail the general examination may, with departmental recommendation, retake the exam within one year. Failure to pass the second attempt results in termination of Ph.D. candidacy.
- **Fail with no option to retake:** In this case, the student’s enrollment is terminated.

### Readmission after the Exam

In most UOS programs, students are not readmitted to their third year (fifth term) unless they have passed the general examination and fulfilled all residence and departmental requirements. No student should be readmitted to a fourth year (seventh term) without having successfully completed the general examination.
