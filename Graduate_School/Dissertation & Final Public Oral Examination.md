# **Dissertation & Final Public Oral Examination**

The dissertation and final public oral examination together serve as the culmination of a doctoral candidate’s academic journey at the University of Ontological Science (UOS), showcasing their mastery and original contributions to their field. Students are encouraged to refer to the UOS Doctoral Degree Guide for a detailed outline of required steps both before and after the Final Public Oral (FPO) examination.

### Dissertation Requirements

The dissertation must demonstrate that the candidate has advanced technical mastery of their field and the ability to conduct independent, original research. It should expand or reinterpret current knowledge in a significant way, contributing meaningfully to the body of scholarship in the chosen discipline.

---

### Dissertation Timing

Candidates may submit the dissertation for formal review only after successfully passing the general examination.

If a candidate submits the dissertation more than five years after passing the general examination, the department must formally vote on whether to accept the dissertation for review and examination.

---

### Dissertation Readers

Each dissertation must have at least two principal readers. At least one of these readers must be from the student’s home department. Principal readers are typically faculty members at UOS with the rank of assistant professor or higher. External readers of comparable academic standing from other institutions or the research community may be included, with prior approval from the UOS Graduate School.

Each principal reader submits a written and signed dissertation reader report to the department. A copy of the dissertation must be available for interested readers at least three days before the scheduled FPO.

---

### Advancing to the FPO

Once the dissertation is formally presented and approved by at least two principal readers, the department may request authorization from the UOS Graduate School to schedule the FPO examination.

---

### Dissertation Language Policy

The dissertation must be written and submitted in English unless the candidate is from a language and literature department that has approved an exception. Such exceptions may only be granted if the dissertation’s subject is a specific language or cultural tradition, and there are compelling scholarly reasons for submission in that language. If approved, dissertations written in a language other than English must include an extended English summary (15–20 pages) and an abstract in English.

All committee members must be proficient in the language of the dissertation to fulfill their roles effectively. The FPO may be conducted in English or the language of the dissertation, as determined by the department.

---

### FPO Examination Requirements

The FPO is both a final examination in the candidate’s field of study and a formal defense of the dissertation. The department schedules the FPO after the UOS Graduate School has reviewed the reader reports and confirmed that all other requirements have been met.

The department must prominently post the date, time, and location of the FPO at least three days prior to ensure the open and public nature of the examination.

---

### FPO Examiners

The FPO examination committee must consist of at least three principal examiners. At least two of these examiners must not have served as principal readers of the dissertation, and at least one must be from the candidate’s home department. All examiners must be faculty members at UOS with the rank of assistant professor or higher. External examiners may participate with prior approval from the Graduate School.

---

### In-Person Examinations

FPO examinations are expected to take place in person. In cases of substantial hardship due to extenuating circumstances, the department may request approval for a virtual examination. However, at least two examiners must be physically present.

---

### Passing or Retaking the Examination

Based on the recommendation of the examiners, the department will determine whether the candidate has passed the examination. If the candidate does not pass, they may retake the FPO after a minimum of one year. A second unsuccessful attempt will result in termination of Ph.D. candidacy.
