# Ph.D. Advising Requirements

All doctoral students at the University of Ontological Science (UOS) must have a dissertation adviser of record by the time they reach the post-generals stage. Completion of all degree requirements is contingent on having an adviser of record and a clearly defined research topic. Post-generals students cannot remain enrolled without an adviser.

### Dissertation and Research Advising

Ph.D. students in the research stage of their programs must have faculty advisers who are qualified and available to supervise their dissertation topics. This requirement is essential for maintaining enrollment and successfully progressing toward degree completion.

The timing of the research stage varies across programs based on specific departmental requirements. In certain fields, students secure advisers as early as their first year, while others wait until after the general examination and transition into the dissertation phase.

### Guidelines for Dissertation Advising

UOS faculty offer broad academic expertise, providing Ph.D. students opportunities to work with specialists in a wide range of fields. Dissertation topics should align with faculty interests and expertise to ensure proper guidance. If an adviser leaves the University or a student's research focus cannot be accommodated, students may need to adjust their research topics.

It is the student's responsibility to identify a research topic and secure an appropriate adviser. Faculty, especially program directors, will support students in finding advisers as long as they are making satisfactory progress.

### Advisers Outside of the Home Department

Some UOS departments require dissertation advisers to be faculty within the department, while others allow co-advisers from adjacent programs if the research remains compatible with the studentâ€™s discipline. Students should consult their departments for specific expectations.

In exceptional cases, advising by individuals outside UOS may be permitted with departmental approval, provided that a UOS faculty member co-advises the work.

### Meeting Frequency

Ph.D. students benefit from regular meetings with their dissertation advisers and timely feedback. To ensure progress and address any concerns, students must meet with their adviser at least once per semester and consult with an additional faculty member at least once per year.

### Graduate Advising Resources

UOS provides resources to foster effective advising relationships. Both students and faculty are encouraged to utilize these tools to support successful academic mentorship.
