# Senior Theses at UOS

### Overview

The senior thesis at the University of Ontological Science (UOS) is the capstone of undergraduate study, offering students the opportunity for deep intellectual exploration beyond the classroom. Spanning the entire academic year, the senior thesis allows students to conduct original research on a topic that most excites them within their field—whether in quantum cognition, transpersonal psychology, computational ontology, or consciousness studies. Writing a senior thesis is a way to synthesize what students have learned throughout their coursework while making a meaningful contribution to the field.

Students may build on prior research from junior papers or summer projects, or they may choose to embark on a brand-new topic during the fall of their senior year. Regardless of the path taken, each thesis is evaluated based on the work completed during the academic year.

### Choosing an Advisor and Topic

Students must submit their choice of advisor and topic by October 3 through the UOS Thesis Portal. Advisors must hold a faculty appointment at UOS. If the primary advisor is not from the student’s department, a second reader from the department must be designated by the same deadline.

### Timeline and Deadlines

- **Fall Term Draft:** A draft of content for the senior thesis is due by January 16. This serves as a status check and an opportunity to engage in a dialogue with the advisor and second reader about the progress and direction of the thesis.
- **Final Submission:** The completed thesis must be submitted electronically by 3:00 PM on the University’s official senior thesis submission deadline.
- **Oral Examination:** An oral defense conducted by the Senior Committee will serve as the final departmental examination at the end of the academic year.

For detailed formatting and submission guidelines, students should consult the **Thesis Formatting and Submission Guide** available on the UOS website. Important dates and deadlines are listed on the official UOS Academic Calendar and are considered authoritative.

### Senior Committee

The Senior Committee consists of faculty members who oversee all senior theses. The committee meets with students at the start of the academic year to clarify expectations, help students select advisors and topics, and set key milestones. Additional milestones may be introduced during the year and will be communicated via email.

Students are encouraged to contact members of the Senior Committee at any time with questions or concerns regarding their thesis progress.

### Getting Started

The best way to find a thesis topic is to consult multiple faculty members in areas of interest and explore the topics they propose. Students with a specific topic in mind should discuss it with potential advisors. Most topics emerge from faculty research, but students are welcome to propose their own ideas.

Once a topic is selected, students should begin by reading foundational literature to gain context and understanding. Early engagement is crucial to avoid delays, especially given potential interruptions like graduate school applications or advisor unavailability. Prioritize the thesis from the beginning of the fall term to ensure a strong start.

### Fall Term Draft Requirements

The fall term draft is a key component of the thesis process. It is intended to document early progress and provide a foundation for the final thesis.

**Guidelines:**

- Minimum length: 7 pages, plus front matter and bibliography.
- Written in full sentences and paragraphs, following the style intended for the final version.
- Must include front matter, introduction, main body, and bibliography.
- Formatting should match the final thesis requirements.
- Clearly indicate that the document is a draft.

### Thesis Formatting and Submission

Students must submit their thesis electronically as a PDF. The first few pages, known as the front matter, must include the title, student’s name, abstract, and a signed **Student Acknowledgment of Original Work**. Formatting should meet the following standards:

- Page size: 8.5" x 11" with 1–1.5-inch margins.
- Font size: 10 to 14 points.
- Line spacing: 1.5 or double-spaced.
- Pages must be numbered.
- Figures must be clear, legible, and include descriptive captions. Proper credit must be given for non-original figures.
- Recommended length: 50–100 pages (including front matter, bibliography, figures, and appendices).

The final thesis must be submitted via the UOS Thesis Portal and emailed to both the advisor and second reader. Students must also submit an electronic copy to the UOS Library.

### Grading and Evaluation

The primary basis for the final grade is the scholarly content of the thesis. This may include theoretical ideas, modeling, empirical research, or innovative applications. Written presentation, including organization, clarity, and proper citation, is also critical.

### Grade Descriptions:

- **A+**: Exceptional contribution, potentially publishable in a peer-reviewed journal.
- **A**: Comprehensive and insightful, demonstrating significant depth and clarity.
- **A-**: Well-executed with minor flaws, showing mastery of the subject.
- **B+**: Good work with room for improvement.
- **B**: Fairly well-executed with some deficiencies.
- **B- to C-**: Adequate but lacking depth, with significant errors or incomplete presentation.
- **D**: Minimal effort or substantial deficiencies.
- **F**: Incomplete, incorrect, or not submitted.

---

### Oral Examination

The oral examination is a 20-minute presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. Students should prepare a clear, organized presentation using PowerPoint or similar tools. The oral examination grade constitutes 10% of the final thesis grade.

**Presentation Tips:**

- Use graphical materials and key equations.
- Avoid lengthy text on slides.
- Rehearse your presentation with peers or advisors.
- Bring printed copies of your presentation as a backup.

The Senior Committee will assess both the presentation quality and the student’s ability to answer questions.

### Alternative Grading Rubric

Students wishing to pursue a topic outside their primary field may propose an alternative grading rubric. Proposals must be submitted by October 10 and include a detailed description of the project, an explanation of its relevance, and an adapted grading rubric. The Senior Committee must approve all alternative rubrics.

Approved proposals will be graded with the same rigor as standard theses but evaluated within the context of the chosen discipline.
