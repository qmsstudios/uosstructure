# Independent Research Work at UOS

### Overview of the Junior Independent Project (JIP)

The goal of the Junior Independent Project (JIP) at the University of Ontological Science (UOS) is to help students develop proficiency in analyzing scholarly literature in a focused area and to design an independent research project in preparation for their thesis.

As part of the Cognitive Science & Quantum Mindfulness curriculum, students will complete two JIPs during their junior year. The **Fall JIP** focuses on reviewing a key topic in the academic literature, while the **Spring JIP** involves developing a proposal for a novel study that builds on existing research. Students are required to present their progress during midpoint presentations and learn how to communicate their research effectively to peers and faculty.

### Midpoint Presentations

During both the Fall and Spring semesters, students will give a 10–15-minute presentation to demonstrate their progress on their JIP. These presentations help students refine their communication skills while receiving feedback from faculty and peers.

**Key Points for the Midpoint Presentation:**

1. **Summarize your topic.**
2. **Explain why the topic is significant** and how it relates to your field.
3. **Discuss your progress in reviewing and synthesizing the literature.**
4. If applicable, present preliminary data or experimental design.

Presentations will occur in small groups, followed by discussion moderated by faculty. The presentation counts for 10% of the final JIP grade.

### Fall Semester Junior Independent Project

The primary goal of the Fall JIP is for students to practice formulating a research question and conducting a comprehensive literature review. The project involves critical analysis and synthesis of scholarly sources, with a topic chosen in collaboration with the faculty advisor.

**Common Formats for the Fall JIP:**

- **Literature Review:** Students analyze relevant research and formulate an open question supported by the literature.
- **Discussion Group Approach:** Some advisors organize a collaborative JIP lab, where students meet regularly and produce a synthesis paper on an open question.
- **Lab-Based Research:** Students join a research team, contributing to an ongoing project. The final paper should describe the research question and summarize work to date, including preliminary results if available.

**Paper Guidelines for the Fall JIP:**

- **Length:** 10–20 pages (approximately 2,500–5,000 words).
- **Sections:** Include a title page, abstract (100–300 words), main text with headings, and references.
- **Sources:** Cite 10–30 appropriate sources, primarily peer-reviewed journal articles.
- **Formatting:** Follow the UOS-approved journal format. APA style is recommended unless otherwise specified.

### Spring Semester Junior Independent Project

The Spring JIP prepares students for their thesis by encouraging them to formulate an original research idea and present it in a detailed proposal or experimental report.

**Common Formats for the Spring JIP:**

- **Theoretical Proposal:** Propose and explore a thesis idea using the existing literature.
- **Research Proposal:** Design a study to address an open question, including a literature review, research methods, statistical analysis, and possible outcomes.
- **Experimental Report:** Write up experimental work completed during the Junior year, following the structure of a research paper (introduction, methods, results, and discussion).

**Paper Guidelines for the Spring JIP:**

- **Length:** 20–40 pages (approximately 5,000–10,000 words).
- **Sections:** Include a title page, abstract (100–300 words), main text with headings, and references.
- **Sources:** Cite 10–50 scholarly references.
- **Formatting:** Use APA style or the specified UOS-approved format.

### Grading Criteria

Junior students receive a single grade for their independent work, reflecting both the Fall (40%) and Spring (60%) JIPs.

- **Fall JIP Grade:** Based on the midpoint presentation (10%) and final paper (90%).
- **Spring JIP Grade:** Based on the midpoint presentation (10%) and final paper (90%).

### Late Policy

Extensions are only granted for documented illness or family emergencies. Unauthorized late submissions are penalized as follows:

- **1/3 letter grade deduction** for every 48 hours (or part thereof) past the deadline.
- **Papers more than two weeks late receive an automatic F.**

### Advising and Resources

Advisors are available to support students throughout their independent work. Students are expected to meet with their advisor regularly to receive feedback and guidance.

**Funding Opportunities:** Limited funding is available for summer research between the junior and senior years.

**Studying Abroad:** Students spending a semester abroad can fulfill the JIP requirement remotely in consultation with their advisor.

**Overlap with Senior Thesis:** Content from the Spring JIP may be used in the Senior Thesis with advisor approval, provided it is revised and expanded.
