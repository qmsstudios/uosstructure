**Department of Metaphysics – University of Ontological Science **

### **About the Program**

The **Master of Science in Metaphysics** is a comprehensive and interdisciplinary graduate program that explores **the fundamental nature of reality, existence, causality, and consciousness**. This program provides an in-depth examination of **both classical and contemporary metaphysical theories**, integrating **philosophical inquiry, quantum metaphysics, computational modeling, and ontological structuring** to uncover the deeper mechanisms underlying **the structure of the universe, the nature of time, and the foundations of being**. By bridging **traditional metaphysical thought with emerging scientific and computational frameworks**, students engage in **a rigorous analysis of existence, reality formation, and the interplay between mind and matter**.

A core focus of this program is its **integration of metaphysics with computational and scientific methodologies**, offering students the opportunity to **explore metaphysical structures through the lens of quantum mechanics, information theory, and cognitive modeling**. Through an advanced study of **reality structures, causality models, and consciousness frameworks**, students will develop **methodological approaches to conceptualizing the nature of existence in a systematic and logically structured way**. The program encourages the exploration of **non-classical interpretations of reality, theories of determinism and free will, and the metaphysical implications of contemporary physics**.

Students will engage with **ontological and epistemological models that seek to define the structure of existence, the nature of causality, and the limits of human perception and knowledge**. Through **formalized reasoning, conceptual analysis, and theoretical modeling**, they will be equipped to tackle **complex questions about consciousness, the fabric of reality, and the nature of time and space**. The program’s interdisciplinary approach ensures that graduates gain **both philosophical depth and applied expertise**, allowing them to contribute to **fields such as theoretical research, philosophy of science, computational reality modeling, and consciousness studies**.

Graduates of the **Master of Science in Metaphysics** will emerge as **thought leaders in metaphysical and scientific exploration**, equipped to **analyze, refine, and apply metaphysical principles in academic, scientific, and conceptual research settings**. By synthesizing **classical metaphysical inquiry with contemporary methodologies**, students will be prepared to **contribute to the advancement of metaphysical science, conceptual modeling, and the philosophical foundations of existence and consciousness**.
