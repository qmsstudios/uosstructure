# Master of Science in Esoteric Science – Course Descriptions

### ESO 601 – Foundations of Esoteric Science & Hidden Knowledge Systems (3 credits)  

An introduction to esoteric traditions, metaphysical structures, and hidden knowledge systems. This course explores ancient and modern perspectives on reality, consciousness, and the nature of hidden wisdom. Students will engage with primary texts and contemporary interpretations to develop a foundational understanding of esoteric science.

### ESO 602 – Symbolic Cognition & Archetypal Frameworks (3 credits)  

Examines the role of symbols and archetypes in cognition, exploring how metaphors, mythological structures, and symbolic representations shape perception and consciousness. The course includes analysis of symbolic systems across cultures and their impact on cognitive processes and personal development.

### ESO 603 – The Physics of Consciousness & Reality Structures (3 credits)  

Investigates theories proposing that consciousness plays a fundamental role in reality. Topics include quantum consciousness, the observer effect, and the intersection of physics and metaphysical models. Students will critically evaluate scientific and philosophical perspectives on the nature of consciousness and its influence on the physical world.

### ESO 604 – Non-Dual Cognition & Transcendental Awareness (3 credits)  

Explores non-dual awareness and states of transcendental consciousness. Students will study Eastern and Western models of enlightenment, cognitive dissolution, and self-transcendence. The course includes experiential practices and theoretical frameworks to understand non-dual states.

### Research Methods in Esoteric Studies (3 credits)  

Introduces qualitative and quantitative research methodologies used in esoteric science. Emphasis is placed on symbolic analysis, phenomenological study, and interdisciplinary synthesis. Students will learn to design and conduct research projects that contribute to the field of esoteric studies.

### ESO 605 – Sacred Geometry & Mathematical Structures in Reality (3 credits)  

Analyzes the role of geometric patterns in nature, art, and spiritual traditions. Topics include fractals, the golden ratio, and how mathematical structures underpin physical and metaphysical reality. The course includes practical applications and theoretical explorations of sacred geometry.

### ESO 606 – Theoretical Cosmology & Higher-Dimensional Physics (3 credits)  

Explores alternative cosmological models and theories of higher-dimensional space. Topics include hyperdimensional physics, holographic universe theories, and the esoteric implications of astrophysical discoveries. Students will engage with cutting-edge research and theoretical models.

### ESO 607 – Quantum Hermeticism & Theories of Information (3 credits)  

Examines the intersection of quantum mechanics and Hermetic philosophy, focusing on informational paradigms, energy dynamics, and the transmission of hidden knowledge across time and space. The course includes analysis of historical texts and contemporary scientific theories.

### ESO 608 – Computational Metaphysics & Symbolic AI (3 credits)  

Investigates how computational models can be applied to esoteric frameworks. Topics include symbolic artificial intelligence, ontological modeling, and the use of algorithmic structures in metaphysical research. Students will explore the implications of AI and computational methods for understanding esoteric concepts.

### Research Project in Advanced Esoteric Studies (3 credits)  

A faculty-guided independent research project exploring advanced topics in esoteric science, cognitive metaphysics, or symbolic knowledge systems. Students will develop a research proposal, conduct original research, and present their findings.

### ESO 701 – Multidimensional Awareness & Cognitive Transformation (3 credits)  

Explores theories of multidimensional perception, consciousness expansion, and cognitive restructuring. Students will analyze altered states, higher-order thinking, and transformational cognition. The course includes practical exercises and theoretical discussions.

### ESO 702 – The Role of Metaphor in Consciousness Modeling (3 credits)  

Investigates how metaphor structures our understanding of reality. Topics include cognitive linguistics, symbolic cognition, and the use of metaphor in altered states of consciousness. Students will explore the cognitive and experiential dimensions of metaphor.

### ESO 703 – Philosophical Implications of Hidden Knowledge Systems (3 credits)  

A critical examination of hidden knowledge systems, secret traditions, and their impact on philosophy, science, and epistemology. The course includes analysis of historical and contemporary perspectives on esoteric knowledge.

### Elective in Metaphysics, Epistemology, or Cognitive Science (3 credits)  

A selected elective that allows students to expand their studies in a related field of inquiry, such as metaphysical modeling, epistemic frameworks, or consciousness studies. Students will choose from a range of topics to deepen their understanding of specific areas of interest.

### Independent Research in Esoteric Science (3 credits)  

An advanced, self-directed research course where students explore a specialized topic in esoteric science under faculty supervision. The course includes the development of a research proposal, data collection, analysis, and presentation of findings.

### ESO 704 – Capstone Thesis in Esoteric Science & Reality Modeling (6 credits)  

A culminating research thesis that synthesizes core concepts from esoteric science, metaphysical modeling, and consciousness studies into a structured research project. Students will work closely with faculty advisors to develop and complete their thesis.

### ESO 705 – Experimental Research in Symbolic Knowledge & Metaphysical Modeling (3 credits)  

Focuses on designing and conducting experimental research in esoteric knowledge systems, symbolic structures, and metaphysical modeling, integrating theoretical and applied perspectives. Students will learn to apply experimental methods to explore esoteric concepts.
