## **Core Courses (24 credits):**

1. ### **QCO 501 – Foundations of Quantum Cognition**

This course provides an introduction to the field of quantum cognition, exploring the application of quantum probability theory to cognitive processes such as decision-making and perception. Students will learn about the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and how these principles can be applied to understand complex cognitive phenomena. Key topics include quantum probability, wave functions, and the role of measurement in cognitive processes.

2. ### **QCO 502 – Cognitive Superposition and Mental States**

In this course, students will study the concept of cognitive superposition, where mental states coexist in a superposed state before conscious collapse. The course will focus on theories of ambiguous cognition and potential states, examining how these theories can explain phenomena such as indecision and ambivalence. Students will explore experimental evidence and theoretical models that support the existence of cognitive superposition.

3. ### **QCO 503 – Psychodynamic Wave Interference**

This course examines the interaction between conflicting cognitive states and how they shape perceptions and decisions. Students will learn about the concept of wave interference in the context of psychodynamics, exploring how different cognitive states can interfere with each other to produce complex patterns of thought and behavior. The course will cover topics such as cognitive dissonance, conflict resolution, and the role of unconscious processes in decision-making.

4. ### **QCO 504 – Non-Local Cognition and Mental Connectivity**

In this course, students will explore the concept of non-local cognition, focusing on theories of entanglement in psychological processes and cross-dimensional cognitive influences. The course will examine how cognitive states can be interconnected across space and time, leading to phenomena such as telepathy and collective consciousness. Students will study experimental evidence and theoretical models that support the existence of non-local cognitive connections.

5. ### **QCO 505 – Sequential Cognitive Influence and Time Perception**

This course focuses on the study of time perception and sequential cognitive influences on memory, experience, and decision-making. Students will learn about the mechanisms by which cognitive processes unfold over time and how these processes influence our perception of time. The course will cover topics such as temporal dynamics of memory, the role of anticipation in decision-making, and the impact of temporal context on cognitive performance.

6. ### **QCO 506 – Cognitive Measurement and Mind States**

In this course, students will analyze how conscious measurement collapses cognitive potentials into definite states. The course will emphasize measurement theory in cognitive psychology, exploring how the act of measurement can influence cognitive outcomes. Students will learn about different measurement techniques and their applications in cognitive research, as well as the philosophical implications of measurement in the context of quantum cognition.

7. ### **QCO 699 – Capstone Research in Quantum Cognition**

This course is a culminating research project that integrates quantum cognitive theories with experimental or applied research. Students will be required to design and conduct a comprehensive research project that addresses a specific question or problem in the field of quantum cognition. The capstone project will culminate in a written thesis that presents the research findings and their implications for the field. Students will also be required to present their research in a formal presentation.
