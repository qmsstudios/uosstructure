Introduction to the principles and practices of ontological engineering, focusing on building formal systems and conceptual frameworks for knowledge-based applications. Students will learn about the history and evolution of ontological engineering, key methodologies, and the role of ontologies in various domains. Practical sessions will include the development of ontological models and their implementation in software systems.

2. ### **OEN 502 – Knowledge Graphs & Semantic Web Technologies**

Study of semantic web technologies and knowledge graph development. Emphasis on ontology design patterns and their application in semantic data integration. The course covers RDF, OWL, SPARQL, and other key technologies. Students will engage in projects that involve creating and querying knowledge graphs, as well as integrating semantic web technologies into existing systems.

3. ### **OEN 503 – Formal Methods in Ontological Design**

Exploration of formal methods for designing and validating ontologies. Topics include ontology evaluation, logical consistency, and verification techniques. The course will delve into mathematical foundations, formal languages, and tools for ontology validation. Students will work on case studies to apply formal methods in real-world scenarios, ensuring the robustness and reliability of ontological systems.

4. ### **OEN 504 – Computational Ontology: Theory & Practice**

Integration of computational methods into ontology development. This course provides hands-on experience in designing computational ontologies for real-world applications. Students will explore algorithms, data structures, and software tools used in computational ontology. Practical assignments will involve developing ontologies that can be processed by machines, enhancing their utility in AI and data-driven applications.

5. ### **OEN 505 – AI Integration in Ontological Systems**

Examination of AI-driven approaches in ontology-based systems. Focus on intelligent agents, automated reasoning, and natural language understanding. The course will cover machine learning techniques, knowledge representation, and the integration of AI with ontological frameworks. Students will participate in projects that demonstrate the synergy between AI and ontologies, such as building intelligent systems that leverage ontological knowledge.

6. ### **OEN 506 – Ontological Applications in Cybernetics**

Analysis of cybernetic principles in ontology design. Topics include systems theory, self-regulating systems, and ontological models for adaptive technologies. The course will explore the intersection of cybernetics and ontology, examining how feedback loops and adaptive mechanisms can be modeled ontologically. Students will engage in designing ontological systems that can adapt and respond to changes in their environment.

7. ### **OEN 699 – Capstone Research in Ontological Engineering**

Students will apply their knowledge of ontological engineering in a comprehensive research project. The capstone involves designing, implementing, and evaluating an ontology-based system. Students will work under the guidance of faculty advisors to identify a research problem, develop a project plan, and execute their research. The course culminates in a presentation and defense of their findings, demonstrating their ability to apply ontological engineering principles in a practical context.
