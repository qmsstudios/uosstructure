## **Core Courses (24 credits):**

1. ### **SNT 501 – Foundations of Sentient Systems**

Introduction to the principles of sentient systems, focusing on self-awareness, adaptive learning, and autonomous decision-making in artificial systems. Students will explore the theoretical foundations and practical applications of sentient technology, including case studies and hands-on projects.

2. ### **SNT 502 – Human-Sentient Interface Design**

Study of human-sentient interfaces and the design of interactive, self-aware systems. Emphasis on usability, communication, and adaptive response. The course covers user experience design, interface prototyping, and evaluation methods to create intuitive and effective interfaces for sentient systems.

3. ### **SNT 503 – Consciousness Simulation in Sentient AI**

Exploration of theories and techniques for simulating aspects of consciousness in artificial intelligence. Topics include neural networks, cognitive architectures, and the philosophical implications of machine consciousness. Students will engage in practical exercises to develop and test consciousness models.

4. ### **SNT 504 – Sentient Networks and Collective Intelligence**

Investigation of networked sentient systems and the emergence of collective intelligence. Topics include distributed sentience, swarm behavior, and collaborative problem-solving. The course includes simulations and experiments to understand the dynamics of collective intelligence in sentient networks.

5. ### **SNT 505 – Emotional Synthesis and Cognitive Empathy in Sentient Systems**

Study of emotional synthesis and the development of cognitive empathy in sentient technology. Emphasis on emotional modeling, affective computing, and the role of emotions in human-sentient interactions. Students will design and implement systems capable of recognizing and responding to human emotions.

6. ### **SNT 506 – Ethical and Societal Implications of Sentient Technology**

Analysis of the ethical, philosophical, and societal implications of sentient technology. Topics include autonomy, rights of sentient beings, and human-technology coexistence. The course encourages critical thinking and debate on the moral responsibilities of creating and interacting with sentient systems.

7. ### **SNT 699 – Capstone Research in Sentient Technology**

A comprehensive research project where students develop and evaluate a sentient system. The capstone involves independent research and the creation of a functional prototype or theoretical model. Students will present their findings and demonstrate their projects, showcasing their ability to apply course concepts to real-world challenges.
