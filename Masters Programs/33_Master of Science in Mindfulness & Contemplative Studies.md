The Master of Science in Mindfulness & Contemplative Studies explores the intersection of mindfulness, contemplative traditions, and modern cognitive science. This program provides advanced training in mindfulness-based interventions, contemplative neuroscience, and applied mindfulness practices for personal and professional growth.

Students will engage in experiential learning and research on the cognitive, psychological, and neurological foundations of mindfulness, with an emphasis on emotional regulation, self-compassion, and well-being. This program prepares graduates for roles in research, education, leadership, and integrative health.

## **About the Program**

The Master of Science in Mindfulness & Contemplative Studies combines contemplative practice with scientific research to offer a comprehensive understanding of mindfulness and its practical applications. Students will explore how mindfulness and compassion-based practices enhance cognitive functioning, emotional resilience, and physical well-being.
