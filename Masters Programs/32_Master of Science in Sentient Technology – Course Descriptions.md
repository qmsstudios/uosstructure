**Core Courses (24 credits):**

1.	**SNT 501 – Foundations of Sentient Systems**

Introduction to the principles of sentient systems, focusing on self-awareness, adaptive learning, and autonomous decision-making in artificial systems.

2.	**SNT 502 – Human-Sentient Interface Design**

Study of human-sentient interfaces and the design of interactive, self-aware systems. Emphasis on usability, communication, and adaptive response.

3.	**SNT 503 – Consciousness Simulation in Sentient AI**

Exploration of theories and techniques for simulating aspects of consciousness in artificial intelligence.

4.	**SNT 504 – Sentient Networks and Collective Intelligence**

Investigation of networked sentient systems and the emergence of collective intelligence. Topics include distributed sentience and swarm behavior.

5.	**SNT 505 – Emotional Synthesis and Cognitive Empathy in Sentient Systems**

Study of emotional synthesis and the development of cognitive empathy in sentient technology. Emphasis on emotional modeling and affective computing.

6.	**SNT 506 – Ethical and Societal Implications of Sentient Technology**

Analysis of the ethical, philosophical, and societal implications of sentient technology. Topics include autonomy, rights of sentient beings, and human-technology coexistence.

7.	**SNT 699 – Capstone Research in Sentient Technology**

A comprehensive research project where students develop and evaluate a sentient system. The capstone involves independent research and the creation of a functional prototype or theoretical model.
