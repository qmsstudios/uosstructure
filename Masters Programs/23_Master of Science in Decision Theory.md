The Master of Science in Decision Theory is an advanced program that delves into the principles of rational choice, probabilistic reasoning, and strategic decision-making across complex systems. This interdisciplinary program integrates cognitive science, game theory, behavioral decision models, and applied risk analysis to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and optimizing decision processes.

Students will engage with advanced decision models, probabilistic reasoning frameworks, and multi-agent systems, developing practical skills for applying these theories in real-world decision-making contexts. This program provides both a rigorous theoretical foundation and hands-on experience in applied decision analysis, preparing graduates for roles in research, strategy, and AI-driven decision systems.

**About the Program**

The M.Sc. in Decision Theory is designed for students seeking a deep understanding of decision-making processes and their applications in business strategy, policy analysis, and artificial intelligence. The program integrates classical decision theory with modern advances in cognitive science, behavioral economics, and probabilistic modeling to explore how decisions are made under uncertainty and how they can be optimized.

Students will explore topics such as Bayesian inference, multi-criteria decision-making, and game theory, applying these concepts to real-world challenges. The program emphasizes both the theoretical and practical aspects of decision science, equipping students with the tools to analyze and design decision-support systems and improve strategic outcomes.

Through a research-driven approach, students will develop advanced decision models, explore cognitive biases and ethical dilemmas, and design solutions for dynamic, multi-agent environments. The capstone research project allows students to apply their knowledge to a practical or theoretical decision-making problem, producing innovative solutions and frameworks.
