## **Core Courses (24 credits):**

1. ### **ONT 501 – Advanced Ontological Structures & Modeling**

    This course delves into advanced ontological frameworks, focusing on conceptual modeling and the formal structure of reality. Students will explore both classical and contemporary theories in ontology, learning to construct and analyze complex ontological models. Key topics include the nature of categories, the relationship between objects and properties, and the role of ontologies in various domains such as artificial intelligence and information systems.

2. ### **ONT 502 – Formal Logic & Knowledge Representation**

    This course provides an in-depth study of formal systems in logic and their application to knowledge representation. Students will cover topics such as propositional logic, predicate logic, and logic-based approaches to ontology. The course emphasizes the development of skills in formal reasoning and the application of logical frameworks to represent and reason about knowledge in various contexts.

3. ### **ONT 503 – Ontological Foundations of Reality**

    This course offers an analysis of the metaphysical foundations underlying ontological structures. Students will engage with key ontological debates, such as the nature of existence, the problem of universals, and the structure of reality. The course also examines the role of ontology in understanding the fundamental aspects of reality and existence, drawing on both historical and contemporary perspectives.

4. ### **ONT 504 – Applied Ontology in Philosophy & Science**

    This course explores the application of ontological principles to interdisciplinary fields such as philosophy of science, information systems, and conceptual design. Students will learn how ontological theories can inform and enhance research and practice in these areas. The course includes case studies and practical exercises to illustrate the relevance and impact of ontology in various scientific and philosophical contexts.

5. ### **ONT 505 – Epistemic Frameworks for Ontological Research**

    This course introduces students to epistemic theories and justification frameworks for ontological inquiry. Students will learn how to critically evaluate and construct arguments in ontology, examining the relationship between knowledge and ontology. Topics include theories of truth, justification, and the epistemic foundations of ontological claims. The course aims to equip students with the tools to conduct rigorous and well-founded ontological research.

6. ### **ONT 506 – Ontology and the Nature of Being**

    This course examines the fundamental concepts of being, existence, and identity. Students will trace the evolution of ontological thought from ancient to contemporary philosophy, exploring key questions such as what it means to exist and how entities are individuated. The course includes readings from major philosophical texts and encourages students to engage with ongoing debates in the field of ontology.

7. ### **ONT 699 – Capstone Research in Ontology**

    The capstone research project is the culmination of the Master's program, integrating theoretical and applied knowledge in ontology. Students will conduct independent research on a topic of their choice, under the guidance of a faculty advisor. The project involves the formulation of a research question, a comprehensive literature review, the development of a theoretical framework, and the presentation of findings. The final product is a comprehensive thesis that contributes to the field of ontology, demonstrating the student's ability to conduct original and significant research.
