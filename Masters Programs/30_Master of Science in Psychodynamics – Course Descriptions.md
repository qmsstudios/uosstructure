3. ### **PSY 503 – Cognitive Psychodynamics and Mental Structures**

Exploration of cognitive psychodynamic models that integrate traditional psychodynamic theories with cognitive science. This course covers the interplay between cognitive processes and unconscious dynamics, examining how mental structures influence behavior and thought patterns.
