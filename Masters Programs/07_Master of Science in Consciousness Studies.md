The Master of Science in Consciousness Studies offers an advanced exploration of transcendent cognition, altered states of awareness, and quantum consciousness theory. This program is meticulously designed for students keen on delving into philosophical consciousness exploration, understanding neural correlates of awareness, and engaging in psychospiritual research. It aims to equip students with a scientific and theoretical framework for the evolution of consciousness.

## **About the Program**

The Master of Science in Consciousness Studies provides a comprehensive approach to studying the intricate phenomena of consciousness through an interdisciplinary lens that merges cognitive science, theoretical physics, and meditative practices. Through courses like meditative studies, non-local cognition, and neural mapping, students will gain a deep understanding of the dynamic interplay between consciousness and the physical world.

This program emphasizes the development of expertise in analyzing and mapping the neural mechanisms underlying consciousness and exploring the theoretical aspects of quantum mechanics related to consciousness studies. Students will be encouraged to critically assess both empirical and theoretical models, fostering an integrated perspective on transcendent cognition.
