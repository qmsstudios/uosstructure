**Core Courses (24 credits):**

1.	**QCO 501 – Foundations of Quantum Cognition**

Introduction to quantum cognition, exploring the application of quantum probability theory to cognitive processes such as decision-making and perception.

2.	**QCO 502 – Cognitive Superposition and Mental States**

Study of cognitive superposition, where mental states coexist before conscious collapse. Focus on theories of ambiguous cognition and potential states.

3.	**QCO 503 – Psychodynamic Wave Interference**

Examination of the interaction between conflicting cognitive states and how they shape perceptions and decisions.

4.	**QCO 504 – Non-Local Cognition and Mental Connectivity**

Exploration of non-local cognition, focusing on theories of entanglement in psychological processes and cross-dimensional cognitive influences.

5.	**QCO 505 – Sequential Cognitive Influence and Time Perception**

Study of time perception and sequential cognitive influences on memory, experience, and decision-making.

6.	**QCO 506 – Cognitive Measurement and Mind States**

Analysis of how conscious measurement collapses cognitive potentials into definite states. Emphasis on measurement theory in cognitive psychology.

7.	**QCO 699 – Capstone Research in Quantum Cognition**

A culminating research project integrating quantum cognitive theories with experimental or applied research. The capstone requires a comprehensive thesis.
