The Master of Science in Psychodynamics is an advanced study of the unconscious processes, cognitive dynamics, and psychological forces that shape human experience. This program integrates classical psychodynamic theories with contemporary approaches in cognitive science, neuroscience, and personality psychology, offering students a deep understanding of the mind and human behavior.

Students will explore the intersections of psychodynamic theory, trauma studies, cognitive processes, and personality development while engaging in research-driven and experiential learning. This program is designed for those seeking to apply psychodynamic principles in advanced research, counseling, or innovative fields such as neuropsychology and cognitive psychodynamics.

**About the Program**

The M.Sc. in Psychodynamics provides a comprehensive exploration of psychological development, unconscious processes, and the dynamics of personality and behavior. Students will engage in the study of psychodynamic frameworks while integrating cognitive psychology, trauma studies, and contemporary models of the mind.

The program combines theoretical foundations with applied psychodynamic analysis, emphasizing the study of defense mechanisms, unconscious motivation, and emotional regulation. Students will have the opportunity to engage in research focused on trauma, personality dynamics, and cognitive models of the unconscious mind.

Graduates of this program will be well-prepared for roles in psychodynamic research, personality studies, and neuropsychological applications of psychodynamic theory. The capstone research project allows students to apply psychodynamic concepts to real-world psychological phenomena, contributing to new insights in the field.

**Key Areas of Study**

- Unconscious Processes and Cognitive Dynamics
- Personality Theory and Psychological Development
- Trauma, Memory, and Emotional Processing
- Applied Psychodynamic Analysis and Defense Mechanisms
- Cognitive Psychodynamics and Neuropsychology

**Who Should Enroll?**

This program is ideal for psychologists, counselors, researchers, and professionals interested in deepening their understanding of unconscious processes, personality dynamics, and trauma studies. Whether pursuing careers in research, clinical practice, or academic study, this program equips graduates with the expertise to analyze and apply psychodynamic frameworks in both traditional and innovative contexts.
