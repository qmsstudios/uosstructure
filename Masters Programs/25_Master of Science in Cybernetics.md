The Master of Science in Cybernetics is an advanced exploration of complex systems, feedback mechanisms, and adaptive control in biological, technological, and social systems. This interdisciplinary program bridges systems theory, robotics, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence to provide a comprehensive understanding of how systems communicate, self-regulate, and evolve.

Students will engage with theoretical frameworks and practical applications in robotics, neural networks, cyber-physical systems, and human-machine interfaces. This program prepares graduates for advanced roles in research, system design, and emerging fields such as bio-cybernetics, adaptive AI, and intelligent systems.

**About the Program**

The M.Sc. in Cybernetics offers a deep dive into the principles of systems theory, control, and adaptation across natural and artificial systems. Students will learn how to model, analyze, and design self-regulating systems in areas such as robotics, neural networks, computational biology, and cognitive cybernetics.

The program integrates computational modeling, feedback theory, and applied control systems to prepare students for solving real-world challenges in adaptive technology and intelligent infrastructure. Emphasis is placed on cyber-physical systems, human-machine interaction, and bio-inspired robotics.

Through hands-on research and applied learning, students will develop expertise in designing and managing intelligent systems that adapt and respond to dynamic environments. The capstone project allows students to apply their knowledge to practical or theoretical problems, creating innovative solutions in the field of cybernetics.
