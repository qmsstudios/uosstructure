The Master of Science in Ontology is an advanced exploration of the nature of being, formal structures of existence, and the application of ontological frameworks in artificial intelligence, logic, and knowledge representation. Students will engage in formal ontology, computational metaphysics, and philosophical modeling to develop practical and theoretical approaches to structuring reality, knowledge systems, and AI cognition. This program provides a rigorous foundation in both classical and computational ontology, preparing graduates for specialized research and applied roles in formal knowledge structures.

### **About the Program**

The Master of Science in Ontology is an advanced exploration of the nature of being, formal structures of existence, and the application of ontological frameworks in artificial intelligence, logic, and knowledge representation. Students will engage in formal ontology, computational metaphysics, and philosophical modeling to develop practical and theoretical approaches to structuring reality, knowledge systems, and AI cognition.

This program prepares graduates for roles in ontology engineering, AI knowledge representation, epistemic modeling, and formal logic research.

## **About the Program**

The Master of Science in Ontology is designed for those seeking an advanced understanding of ontological systems and their applications in philosophy, artificial intelligence, and formal logic. This program integrates classical ontological theories with modern computational approaches to explore the fundamental structures of existence, knowledge classification, and conceptual modeling.

Students will engage with formal ontology, epistemic modeling, and AI-driven knowledge representation, applying these frameworks to areas such as semantic reasoning, logical structuring, and intelligent systems. By bridging philosophical inquiry with applied computational methodologies, this program provides the skills necessary to design, analyze, and implement ontological frameworks in both theoretical and real-world contexts.

Through a research-driven and analytical approach, students will learn to construct and refine ontological models that support advanced AI cognition, conceptual engineering, and structured reasoning.

## **Key Areas of Study**

**Formal Ontology and Philosophical Modeling

**Computational Metaphysics and Knowledge Representation

**Ontological Engineering and AI Semantics
