TUOS releases admission decisions twice per year, providing applicants with flexibility in their application choices. Students may opt for **early application** or **regular decision**, depending on their readiness and academic goals.

### **Early Application - Priority Notification**

Applicants who submit their materials by the early application deadline may receive one of three responses:

- **Accepted** – The applicant has been granted admission for the upcoming academic term.
- **Deferred** – The application will be reviewed again during the regular decision cycle.
- **Denied** – The applicant is not admitted for the current cycle but may apply again in the future.

TUOS offers two early application pathways:

- **Early Decision** – Applicants who apply under this plan make a binding commitment to attend TUOS if admitted. Financial aid decisions are released alongside admissions decisions, and students receiving an adequate financial aid package must withdraw all other applications and commit to TUOS.
- **Early Action** – This non-binding option allows students to apply early and receive an admission decision without requiring a commitment to enroll. Under this plan, applicants may apply to other institutions’ regular decision programs but may not simultaneously apply to another private institution’s early decision or restrictive early action plan.

### **Regular Decision - Spring Notification**

Applicants who apply under the **regular decision process** will receive their admission decisions in **late March**. Admitted students have until **May 1** to confirm their enrollment.

- **Common Reply Date** – All students admitted under the regular decision process must submit their enrollment confirmation by **May 1**.
- **Waiting Lists** – TUOS may offer some applicants a place on a waiting list. Students choosing to remain on the waitlist will typically receive a final decision by **July 1**, depending on available space. Students who accept admission at one institution but later receive an offer from the TUOS waitlist must promptly notify their original institution of their withdrawal before committing to TUOS.

TUOS reserves the right to rescind offers of admission for students who attempt to hold confirmed places at multiple institutions concurrently.
