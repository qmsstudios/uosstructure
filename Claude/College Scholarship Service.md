# CSS Profile Guide

## Navigating Key Financial Aid Applications at TUOS

The College Scholarship Service (CSS) Profile are the primary financial aid applications that help the University of Ontological Science determine your eligibility for various types of financial assistance. This comprehensive guide will help you understand and successfully complete these important applications.

## Understanding the Applications

### CSS Profile Overview
The College Scholarship Service (CSS) Profile is an application used by TUOS and many other private colleges to determine your eligibility for institutional (non-federal) financial aid. The CSS Profile:
- Collects more detailed financial information than the FAFSA
- Provides a more complete picture of your family's financial situation
- Allows for consideration of special financial circumstances
- Helps TUOS award institutional grants and scholarships effectively

## Before You Begin

### Gathering Required Information
For both applications, you'll need:

**Personal Information:**
- Social Security Numbers (for you and your parents, if dependent)
- Dates of birth
- Marriage dates (if applicable)
- Alien Registration Number (if not a U.S. citizen)

**Financial Information:**
- Federal tax returns (most recent year)
- W-2 forms and other records of income
- Bank statements
- Records of investments
- Records of untaxed income
- Business and farm records (if applicable)

**Educational Information:**
- List of colleges to receive your information (including TUOS)
- High school information

### Creating Necessary Accounts

- **CSS Profile**: Create a College Board account at cssprofile.collegeboard.org

## Completing the CSS Profile

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Access the CSS Profile**: Go to cssprofile.collegeboard.org (available October 1)
2. **Register or log in to your College Board account**: Use existing account or create new one
3. **Select the appropriate academic year**: Ensure you're completing the correct form
4. **Complete the application**: Follow on-screen instructions in each section
5. **Add TUOS to your list of recipients**: Use TUOS's CSS code (3XXX)
6. **Provide more detailed financial information**: More comprehensive than FAFSA
7. **Answer TUOS-specific questions**: Some questions are customized for our institution
8. **Upload any requested documents**: Tax returns or other supporting documentation
9. **Pay the application fee**: Fee waivers are available for eligible students
10. **Submit the application**: Remember to print or save the confirmation page

### Key CSS Profile Tips
- **Allow sufficient time**: The CSS Profile is more detailed than the FAFSA
- **Be prepared to answer additional questions**: The Profile goes deeper into financial details
- **Have your tax returns on hand**: You'll need specific line items
- **Document special circumstances**: Use the additional information section to explain unique situations
- **Review carefully before submitting**: Corrections after submission are more difficult

## Important Differences Between FAFSA and CSS Profile

### Methodology Differences
- **Home Equity**: Not considered on FAFSA, may be considered on CSS Profile
- **Business Value**: Treated differently between applications
- **Medical Expenses**: More detailed reporting on CSS Profile
- **Family Structure**: CSS Profile considers more details about blended families
- **Non-Custodial Parent**: CSS Profile may require information from both divorced/separated parents

### Cost Considerations
- **FAFSA**: Always free to complete
- **CSS Profile**: Has an application fee, though fee waivers are available for eligible students

## After Submission

### What Happens Next
1. **Processing Time**: CSS Profile (2-3 weeks)
2. **Verification Process**: Some students are selected for verification (submit additional documents if requested)
3. **Financial Aid Package**: TUOS will send your financial aid offer after admission
4. **Appeals Process**: Contact the Financial Aid Office if your circumstances change
