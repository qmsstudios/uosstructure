# Student Records and FERPA Rights

The University of Ontological Science maintains the privacy and security of student educational records in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). This federal law ensures students have specific rights regarding their academic records while establishing guidelines for their protection and disclosure.

## Your Rights Under FERPA

As a TUOS student, FERPA grants you the right to inspect and review your educational records within 45 days of submitting a request. You may request amendments to records you believe are inaccurate or misleading. The university requires your written consent before disclosing personally identifiable information from your educational records, except in circumstances permitted by law.

## Accessing Your Records

Current and former students may request access to their educational records through our secure student portal. Your records include academic transcripts, research documentation, enrollment information, and other materials directly related to your educational experience at TUOS.

Submit your request through the student portal, specifying which records you wish to review. The appropriate university official will arrange access and notify you of the time and place where you may review the records.

## Requesting Record Amendments

If you believe your educational records contain inaccurate or misleading information, you may request an amendment. Submit a written request clearly identifying the specific information you wish to change and explaining why it should be modified. The university will notify you of its decision regarding your amendment request.

Should the university decide not to amend the record, you have the right to request a formal hearing. Additional information regarding hearing procedures will be provided when you are notified of this right.
