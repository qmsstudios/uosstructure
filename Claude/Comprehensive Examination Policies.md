# Comprehensive Examination Policies
## The University of Ontological Science

### Overview

The Comprehensive Examination ("Comps") represents a critical milestone in a student's academic journey at TUOS. This examination evaluates not only the breadth and depth of a student's knowledge in their field of study, but also their ability to synthesize concepts across disciplines, apply theoretical frameworks to novel problems, and articulate complex ideas with clarity and precision.

### Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for the Comprehensive Examination, students must:

1. Have completed at least 75% of their required coursework with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.2
2. Have no outstanding incomplete grades or academic probations
3. Receive formal recommendation from their primary academic advisor
4. Submit their Comprehensive Examination Application at least one term prior to their intended examination date

### Examination Format

The Comprehensive Examination consists of three components:

1. **Written Examination** (8 hours)
   * Four essay questions covering foundational theories, current research, methodological approaches, and interdisciplinary applications
   * Students will have access to a designated digital library but no external resources

2. **Oral Examination** (2-3 hours)
   * Defense of written responses
   * Additional questioning on areas requiring clarification or expansion
   * Conducted by a committee of 3-5 faculty members, including the student's advisor

3. **Integrative Project Proposal** (submitted two weeks prior to oral examination)
   * 15-20 page proposal demonstrating how the student's specialized knowledge addresses a significant question in their field
   * Must incorporate at least three distinct theoretical perspectives or methodological approaches

### Evaluation Criteria

Examiners will evaluate student performance based on:

* Comprehensive understanding of core theoretical frameworks
* Ability to critically analyze competing perspectives
* Skill in applying abstract concepts to concrete problems
* Capacity for interdisciplinary integration and synthesis
* Clarity and coherence of written and oral expression
* Originality and creativity in approaching complex questions

### Results and Remediation

Possible examination outcomes include:

* **Pass with Distinction**: Outstanding performance across all components
* **Pass**: Satisfactory demonstration of required knowledge and skills
* **Conditional Pass**: Adequate performance with specific deficiencies requiring additional work
* **Fail**: Significant gaps in knowledge requiring a retake of the examination

Students who receive a conditional pass must complete remedial work within one term. Students who fail may retake the examination once, no sooner than the following term. A second failure will result in dismissal from the program.

### Accommodations

We are committed to providing equitable opportunities for all students. Those requiring accommodations due to documented disabilities should consult with the Office of Student Accessibility Services at least two months prior to their examination date.

### Appeals Process

Students wishing to appeal their examination results must submit a written petition to the Dean of Graduate Studies within two weeks of receiving their results, clearly stating the grounds for appeal. Appeals are considered only in cases of procedural irregularities or demonstrable bias.
