# Name Changes on Diplomas

## The University of Ontological Science

### Overview

At TUOS, we recognize that names hold deep personal significance and may change throughout your lifetime due to marriage, divorce, gender affirmation, or other personal or legal reasons. We are committed to ensuring your academic credentials reflect your authentic identity. This policy outlines the process for requesting name changes on diplomas, transcripts, and other official university documents.

### Policy Statement

TUOS supports the right of alumni to update their name on university records and credentials to reflect their current legal name. We strive to make this process respectful, straightforward, and dignified for all community members.

### Types of Name Change Requests

We accommodate several categories of name change requests:

1. **Legal name changes** (marriage, divorce, court-ordered changes)
2. **Gender affirmation name changes**
3. **Preferred name changes** (for certain documents only)
4. **Correction of spelling errors** on original documents

### Requirements for Name Changes on Diplomas

To request a name change on your diploma, you must provide:

1. **Completed Name Change Request Form** available through the Registrar's Office or online through the Alumni Portal
2. **Supporting documentation** appropriate to your situation:
   * Legal name change: Marriage certificate, divorce decree, or court order
   * Gender affirmation: Court order or updated government-issued ID (additional documentation may be waived in certain circumstances; please contact the Office of Inclusive Excellence)
   * Correction of spelling errors: Original diploma and evidence of correct spelling
3. **Processing fee**: $75 for a replacement diploma with your updated name
   * This fee may be waived in cases of university error or in certain hardship situations

### Process for Requesting a Name Change

1. **Submit your request** through one of the following channels:
   * Online: Complete the electronic form in the Alumni Portal
   * Email: Send scanned documents to namechanges@tuos.edu
   * Mail: Office of the Registrar, TUOS, 1234 Philosophy Way, Ontologia, OT 12345
   * In person: Visit the Office of the Registrar during business hours

2. **Document verification**
   * Our staff will review your documentation within 5-7 business days
   * You will receive confirmation when your request has been approved

3. **Processing of new credentials**
   * Standard processing time for replacement diplomas is 4-6 weeks
   * Expedited processing (2-3 weeks) is available for an additional $25 fee

### Additional Considerations

* **Historical Records**: While we update your name on all future credentials and in current systems, some historical records maintained for administrative purposes may retain your previous name with appropriate privacy protections.

* **Multiple Documents**: If you need both a diploma and transcript updated, please indicate this on your request form. Transcript name changes do not incur an additional fee beyond the standard transcript order cost.

* **Name Change vs. Duplicate Diploma**: If you are only requesting a duplicate diploma without a name change, please refer to our Duplicate Diploma Request process.

* **International Students and Alumni**: We recognize that documentation requirements may vary by country. Please contact the International Student and Scholar Services office for guidance on your specific situation.

### Privacy and Confidentiality

TUOS is committed to protecting your privacy throughout the name change process. All documentation submitted for name changes is treated as confidential and handled in accordance with FERPA and university privacy policies.

### Special Circumstances

We understand that some name change situations may involve unique circumstances. If you have concerns about documentation requirements or need additional accommodations, please contact the Office of Inclusive Excellence at inclusive@tuos.edu for confidential assistance.
