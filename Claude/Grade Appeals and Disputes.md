# Grade Appeals and Disputes

The University of Ontological Science maintains rigorous academic standards while ensuring fair and equitable assessment of student work. Our grade appeal process provides a structured pathway for students to address grading concerns through appropriate academic channels.

## Understanding Grade Appeals

A grade appeal may be warranted when a student believes a final course grade was assigned incorrectly or inequitably. Valid grounds for appeal include computational errors, failure to follow stated grading criteria, or inconsistent application of academic standards. Given our university's focus on interdisciplinary research and innovative assessment methods, we encourage students to first engage in dialogue with their instructors to understand the evaluation of their work.

## Initial Resolution Process

Students should begin by requesting a grade review consultation with their course instructor. This meeting provides an opportunity to review grading criteria, assessment materials, and resolve potential misunderstandings. Many grade disputes can be resolved effectively through this initial dialogue, particularly in our specialized courses where assessment may involve complex interdisciplinary elements.

## Formal Appeal Process

Should the initial consultation prove unsatisfactory, students may initiate a formal grade appeal. The process consists of several structured phases designed to ensure thorough review while maintaining academic integrity.

Phase One: Written Appeal
Submit a formal written appeal to the department chair within 30 days of grade posting. The appeal must include:
A detailed explanation of the basis for the appeal
Supporting documentation
Outcome of the instructor consultation
Specific resolution sought

Phase Two: Department Review
The department chair reviews the appeal materials and consults with relevant faculty members. This review considers the specific context of our innovative courses and assessment methods while ensuring adherence to established academic standards.

Phase Three: Academic Standards Committee
If unresolved at the department level, the appeal advances to the Academic Standards Committee. This interdisciplinary committee evaluates the appeal within the broader context of university standards and specialized program requirements.

## Timeline and Deadlines

The grade appeal process adheres to specific timeframes to ensure timely resolution:

Initial Consultation: Within first two weeks of the following semester
Formal Appeal Submission: Within 30 days of grade posting
Department Review: Complete within 15 business days
Committee Review: Complete within 20 business days

## Documentation Requirements

Maintaining complete documentation strengthens the appeal process. Students should preserve:

Original course materials and assignments
Correspondence regarding the grade dispute
Grading criteria and rubrics
Evidence supporting the appeal basis
Research documentation, where applicable

## Academic Standards

The grade appeal process upholds TUOS's commitment to academic excellence while recognizing the unique nature of our interdisciplinary programs. Appeals are evaluated based on:

Adherence to stated course objectives
Consistency with grading criteria
Fairness in assessment application
Recognition of interdisciplinary approaches
Alignment with program standards

## Resolution and Implementation

The final decision from the Academic Standards Committee represents the university's official position. When a grade change is warranted, the modification is processed promptly and reflected in the student's academic record. All parties receive written notification of the final decision and its implementation.

## Academic Integrity

The grade appeal process operates within TUOS's broader commitment to academic integrity. All participants are expected to engage in the process honestly and professionally, maintaining the scholarly standards that distinguish our academic community.

## Continuing Academic Progress

Students may continue their academic progression while a grade appeal is under review. However, in cases where the disputed grade affects prerequisites or program advancement, students should consult with their academic advisor regarding appropriate course selection and registration.
