## Semester Structure and Credit Hours

### Standard Semester Format

Fall and Spring semesters at TUOS follow a 15-week instructional format:
* 15 weeks of instruction
* 2 reading days
* 5-day final examination period

### Credit Hour Policy

At TUOS, one credit hour represents:
* 50 minutes of classroom instruction per week for 15 weeks, plus
* A minimum of 2 hours of out-of-class student work for each hour in class

This structure yields approximately 45 hours of combined direct instruction and student work per credit hour.

### Class Meeting Patterns

| Format | Meeting Pattern | Total Contact Hours |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 3-credit MWF | 50 minutes, 3 times per week | 45 hours |
| 3-credit TR | 75 minutes, 2 times per week | 45 hours |
| 3-credit evening | 150 minutes, 1 time per week | 45 hours |
| 4-credit with lab | 150 minutes lecture + 170 minutes lab per week | 60 hours |

### Compressed Formats

Winter and Summer sessions offer courses in compressed formats:
* 3-week intensive format (Winter Session)
* 6-week accelerated format (Summer Sessions)
* 12-week standard format (Full Summer)

These compressed formats maintain the same total instructional hours as semester-length courses.


## Academic Year Structure and Rationale

The TUOS academic calendar is designed with several guiding principles:

* **Balanced Semesters**: Fall and Spring semesters maintain equal instructional days for each weekday.
* **Strategic Breaks**: Breaks are positioned to provide restorative pauses without disrupting learning momentum.
* **Reading Days**: Dedicated preparation time before final examinations supports integration and synthesis of knowledge.
* **Intersession Opportunities**: Winter and Summer sessions offer focused, immersive learning experiences.
* **Thoughtful Transitions**: Adequate time between terms allows for reflection and preparation.

This careful structuring reflects our pedagogical philosophy that effective learning requires both intensive engagement and deliberate reflection.


## Special Academic Events and Traditions

### Fall Convocation
A formal welcome ceremony that marks the official beginning of the academic year. Held approximately three weeks after classes begin, it features academic processions, addresses from university leadership, and recognition of scholarly achievements.

### Spring Symposium
An annual day-long celebration of intellectual inquiry where regular classes are suspended. Students present research, faculty share works in progress, and invited scholars offer perspectives that enrich our community's exploration of ontological questions. 

### Philosophy Day
Celebrated annually in mid-November, this event commemorates the founding of TUOS with lectures, discussions, and social gatherings that highlight the centrality of philosophical inquiry to our mission.

### Thesis and Dissertation Defenses
Public presentations of graduate research occur throughout the academic year, with concentration periods in April-May and November-December. The community is invited to witness these culminating scholarly achievements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: When is the best time to arrive on campus before classes start?**  
A: We recommend arriving at least two days before classes begin to settle in, locate your classrooms, purchase books, and attend any department orientation sessions. New students should plan to attend the full orientation program.

**Q: Are there classes on university holidays?**  
A: No, classes are not held and administrative offices are closed on official university holidays. However, some campus services may operate with limited hours.

**Q: What happens if severe weather affects the academic calendar?**  
A: TUOS has contingency plans for weather-related closures. In case of missed instructional days, make-up sessions may be scheduled on reading days or specific weekends. Faculty may also provide alternative instruction through Canvas.

**Q: Can I stay in campus housing during breaks?**  
A: Residence halls generally close during winter break and between spring and summer terms. Limited break housing is available for international students, student-athletes in season, and students with demonstrated need. Applications for break housing must be submitted at least three weeks before the break begins.

**Q: When are final grades available?**  
A: Final grades are due from faculty five days after the last final examination. Grades are typically available to students 1-2 days after the submission deadline through the Student Portal.

**Q: How do compressed summer and winter courses compare to full-semester courses?**
