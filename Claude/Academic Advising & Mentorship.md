## Accessing Advising & Mentorship Services

The Graduate Advising Center is located in Bergson Hall, Room 210, and is open Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. For specialized appointments with advising staff, schedule through the Graduate Portal at my.tuos.edu/advising.

New students are automatically assigned a provisional advisor and peer mentor upon enrollment, with the expectation that you will refine these relationships during your first semester. We recommend reviewing faculty profiles on our departmental website before arrival and identifying several potential advisors whose interests align with yours.

Regular advising is a program requirement at TUOS, with mandatory check-ins at least once per semester. However, we encourage more frequent engagement with your advising team to maximize the benefits of these important relationships.

At TUOS, we believe that the dialogue between student and mentor represents one of the most powerful elements of graduate educationâ€”a relationship that not only guides your current academic work but shapes your intellectual identity and future contributions to ontological understanding. We invite you to actively engage with the rich mentorship opportunities available in our community.
