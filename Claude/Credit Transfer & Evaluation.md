## Transfer Credit Principles

TUOS evaluates transfer credits based on these foundational principles:

* **Curricular Relevance**: Coursework should align with TUOS's academic programs and philosophical approach
* **Recency**: Knowledge currency is considered in certain rapidly evolving fields
* **Performance**: Minimum grade requirements ensure transfer credits reflect successful learning
* **Degree Integrity**: Residency requirements preserve the distinctive character of a TUOS degree

## Transfer Credit Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Submit Required Documentation

**For U.S. Institutions:**
* Official transcripts sent directly from the issuing institution to TUOS Admissions Office
* Course syllabi for specialized courses or courses without clear TUOS equivalents

**For International Institutions:**
* Course-by-course credential evaluation from approved evaluation services:
  * World Education Services (WES)
  * Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE)
  * SpanTran: The Evaluation Company
* Original language transcripts and certified English translations

**For Military Credit:**
* Joint Services Transcript (JST)
* Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) transcript
* DD-214 form

**For Examination Credit:**
* Official score reports sent directly from the testing agency

### Step 2: Initial Evaluation

Once all documentation is received:
1. Admissions specialists conduct a preliminary review
2. Faculty subject matter experts evaluate specialized coursework
3. International credentials undergo authentication and conversion
4. Military transcripts are aligned with ACE recommendations

### Step 3: Credit Determination

Each course is evaluated based on:
* Alignment with TUOS curriculum
* Credit hours or equivalent academic content
* Course level and rigor
* Learning outcomes comparison
* Recency of completion (especially for technical subjects)

### Step 4: Credit Application

Approved credits are designated as:
* **Direct Equivalents**: Matched to specific TUOS courses
* **Department Electives**: Applied toward departmental requirements without direct equivalency
* **General Electives**: Count toward overall degree requirements

### Step 5: Notification and Appeals

* Initial credit evaluation provided within 4-6 weeks of complete submission
* Detailed transfer credit report available in the Student Portal
* Students may appeal decisions by submitting additional documentation
* Appeals must be initiated within 45 days of initial evaluation

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I know which of my courses will transfer before I apply?**  
A: You can request a preliminary credit evaluation by submitting unofficial transcripts through our [Transfer Credit Estimator](#) tool. This provides a non-binding estimate of transferable credits.

**Q: Will my GPA transfer with my credits?**  
A: No, while courses and credits transfer, grades do not factor into your TUOS GPA. Your GPA at TUOS will be calculated based solely on coursework completed here.

**Q: What if my previous institution was on quarters rather than semesters?**  
A: We convert quarter credits to semester credits using a 2/3 ratio. For example, a 4-quarter-credit course typically converts to 2.67 semester credits.

**Q: Can I transfer credits after I've enrolled at TUOS?**  
A: Current students must receive prior approval before taking courses at another institution. Complete the [Permission to Study Elsewhere Form](#) before enrolling in external courses.

**Q: How do transfer credits appear on my TUOS transcript?**  
A: Transfer credits appear with the course title, credits awarded, and a "TR" grade notation. The original grade does not appear on your TUOS transcript but remains on your originating institution's transcript.

**Q: What if a course I took covers the same material as two different TUOS courses?**  
A: In some cases, a single transfer course may satisfy multiple TUOS requirements if the content coverage is sufficient. This determination is made during the faculty review process.
