# Degree Audit & Progress Reports

## Tracking Your Academic Journey at TUOS

At The University of Ontological Science, we view the path to your degree as a meaningful intellectual journey rather than merely a checklist of requirements. While your educational experience transcends any system of measurement, our Degree Audit and Progress Reports provide valuable tools to help you navigate your academic path with clarity and purpose. These tools allow you to track your progress, make informed decisions about course selection, and ensure you're moving steadily toward the completion of your degree requirements.


## Understanding Your Degree Audit

### What is a Degree Audit?

A Degree Audit is a comprehensive evaluation of your academic progress that matches your completed and in-progress coursework against the requirements for your degree program. This dynamic document serves as your academic roadmap, helping you understand:

* Which requirements you have already completed
* Which requirements are currently in progress
* Which requirements still need to be fulfilled
* How your transfer credits apply to your degree
* Your progress toward graduation eligibility

### Accessing Your Degree Audit

1. Log in to the [TUOS Student Portal](#)
2. Navigate to the "Academics" section
3. Select "Degree Audit"
4. Choose your current program or use "What If" scenarios to explore other programs

## Types of Progress Reports

TUOS offers several types of academic progress reports to help you monitor your journey from different perspectives:

The comprehensive evaluation of your progress toward degree completion, showing all requirements and your status for each.

### What-If Analysis

A powerful planning tool that allows you to:
* Explore how your completed coursework would apply to a different major

* Understand the requirements for a double major
* Evaluate the implications of changing catalog years

To run a What-If Analysis:
1. Access the Degree Audit system

Your academic advisor can help you develop a comprehensive Academic Plan that aligns with your educational goals.

* Assess progress toward Latin honors or academic standing requirements


## Specialized Audit Features

### Transfer Credit Evaluation

Your audit clearly indicates how transfer credits have been applied:
* Which requirements have been satisfied by transfer work
* Course equivalencies established
* Credits accepted but not applied to specific requirements
* Credits pending evaluation

If you believe transfer credits have not been properly applied, consult the [Transfer Credit Appeal Process](#).

### Exception Processing

Occasionally, approved exceptions to standard requirements are processed:
* Course substitutions
* Requirement waivers
* Adjusted credit values
* Non-standard applications of coursework

These exceptions, once approved through proper channels, will be reflected in your audit with special notation.

### Honors and Distinction Tracking

For students in honors programs or pursuing graduation with distinction, the audit tracks:
* Honors course requirements
* Thesis or capstone progress
* GPA thresholds for Latin honors
* Special requirements for departmental honors


## Using Your Degree Audit Effectively

### Pre-Registration Planning

Before your registration date:
1. Review your Degree Audit to identify remaining requirements
2. Prioritize courses needed for sequential requirements
3. Note any prerequisites you need to complete
4. Identify courses that fulfill multiple requirements
5. Consult with your advisor about optimal course selections

### Regular Progress Checks

We recommend checking your audit:
* After registering for classes
* After grades are posted each semester
* When considering program changes
* One year before anticipated graduation
* When applying for graduation

### Graduation Preparation

As you approach graduation:
1. Review your audit for any unmet requirements
2. Verify that in-progress courses will satisfy remaining needs
3. Check for minimum grade requirements in your major
4. Confirm overall GPA meets university requirements
5. Ensure residency requirements have been met

*Note: While the Degree Audit is a valuable tool, it is not the official certification of your graduation eligibility. Final graduation clearance requires formal review by the Registrar's Office.*


## Common Questions and Troubleshooting

### Audit Accuracy

While our Degree Audit system is designed to be accurate and comprehensive, you should be aware of certain limitations:

* **Timing of Updates**: Changes in registration or grades may take 24-48 hours to reflect in your audit
* **Recent Curriculum Changes**: New program requirements may require system updates
* **Complex Requirements**: Some nuanced requirements may not be perfectly captured
* **In-Progress Assumptions**: The system assumes successful completion of in-progress courses

If you notice discrepancies in your audit, please follow these steps:
1. Compare the audit against the official catalog requirements for your program
2. Consult with your academic advisor about potential errors
3. If necessary, submit a [Degree Audit Correction Request](#)

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Course appears in wrong requirement section | May need course substitution form or audit correction |
| Transfer course not properly applied | Contact Transfer Credit Office for reevaluation |
| Requirements changed from previous audit | Check if catalog year has changed or curriculum updates applied |
| Course counted twice or not at all | May involve special rule for cross-listed or repeatable courses |
| Missing prerequisite notification | Some prerequisites are enforced at registration, not in the audit |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why does my audit show a requirement as incomplete when I'm currently taking the course?**  
A: The audit distinguishes between completed requirements and those "in progress." Requirements with courses currently in progress will show as pending completion (⟳) rather than fully complete (✓).

**Q: What should I do if I think there's an error in my degree audit?**  
A: First, consult with your academic advisor to verify that there is indeed an error. If confirmed, your advisor can help submit a Degree Audit Correction Request to the Registrar's Office.

**Q: How often is my degree audit updated?**  
A: Your audit is updated in real-time when you access it, reflecting your current registration status. However, grade updates and requirement changes may take 24-48 hours to process fully.

**Q: Can I see how close I am to graduating with Latin honors?**  
A: Yes, the audit includes your current cumulative GPA and indicates which Latin honors category (if any) you would qualify for based on current performance.

**Q: If my What-If Analysis shows I can complete a different major without extending my graduation date, can I switch without approval?**  
A: No, the What-If tool is for planning purposes only. You must still formally declare any program change through the appropriate academic department and approval process.

**Q: Does my audit show if I'm meeting financial aid satisfactory academic progress requirements?**  
A: The degree audit focuses on academic requirements rather than financial aid eligibility. For information about satisfactory academic progress for financial aid, please consult the Financial Aid Office.
