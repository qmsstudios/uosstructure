# Auditing a Course

## Intellectual Exploration Without Academic Pressure

At The University of Ontological Science, we recognize that learning extends beyond the pursuit of credits and degrees. The course audit option offers students, faculty, staff, alumni, and qualified community members the opportunity to engage with course material for the pure joy of intellectual growth—without the pressure of formal evaluation or degree requirements.

## What Does It Mean to Audit a Course?

Auditing a course allows you to attend class sessions, engage with the material, and participate in the learning community without receiving academic credit or a letter grade. As an auditor, you'll have access to:

* Regular class sessions and lectures
* Course materials and readings
* Canvas/learning management system resources
* Faculty expertise and in-class discussions

### Auditor Expectations

While auditing offers more flexibility than credit enrollment, auditors are still expected to:

* Attend class regularly (typically at least 70% of sessions)
* Engage respectfully with the learning community
* Follow the instructor's guidelines for auditor participation
* Complete reading assignments necessary for meaningful participation

The specific expectations for auditors vary by course and instructor, and will be clearly outlined in the Audit Agreement you'll complete when registering.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I receive credit retroactively for a course I originally audited?**  
A: No, to receive credit for a course, you must be registered in credit status from the beginning. If you wish to receive credit for the subject matter, you would need to register for the course in a future semester.

**Q: As an auditor, do I have access to all university resources?**  
A: Auditors receive access to course-specific resources, library privileges, and basic campus services. However, access to certain specialized facilities, equipment, or student-specific services may be limited.

**Q: Do audited courses count toward degree requirements?**  
A: No, audited courses do not fulfill degree requirements, prerequisites, or general education requirements.

**Q: Will I have access to the professor outside of class?**  
A: While auditors may participate in regular office hours, priority is given to students taking the course for credit. Some professors may set specific office hour times for auditors.

**Q: Can I audit the same course multiple times?**  
A: Generally, auditing the same course more than once is discouraged unless the course content has substantially changed. Approval for re-auditing is at the discretion of the instructor and department.
