## Formatting Support Resources

Templates in both Word and LaTeX formats are available on the Graduate School website (graduate.tuos.edu/thesis-templates). The Writing Center offers formatting consultations by appointment, and monthly thesis formatting workshops are conducted throughout the academic year.

For specific questions about these guidelines, contact the Thesis & Dissertation Office at thesis@tuos.edu or 555-123-4567. Individual formatting consultations can be scheduled through the Graduate Portal.

We recommend reviewing these guidelines early in your writing process and checking your document against the formatting requirements periodically rather than attempting to reformat the entire document just before submission. The final format review typically requires 5-7 business days, so plan accordingly to meet graduation deadlines.

Your thesis or dissertation represents both the culmination of your graduate studies and your entry into the scholarly conversation of your discipline. By adhering to these formatting standards, you ensure that your contribution will be accessible, professional, and enduring—a permanent testament to your intellectual achievement at The University of Ontological Science.
