## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I forget my registration time?**  
A: Your specific registration time is displayed in the Student Portal under "Registration Status." You can register any time after your assigned time, but not before.

**Q: How many credits should I take each semester?**  
A: Full-time undergraduate students typically take 15-18 credits per semester. Graduate students typically take 9-12 credits. Your advisor can help determine the appropriate course load based on your individual circumstances.

**Q: What happens if all my preferred courses are full?**
