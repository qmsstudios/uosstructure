## Principles Guiding the Grievance and Appeal Process

All academic grievances and appeals at TUOS are handled according to these foundational principles:

* **Good Faith**: All parties are expected to engage in the process with honesty, respect, and a genuine commitment to resolution.

* **Timeliness**: Grievances must be initiated within specified timeframes, and the university is committed to prompt resolution.

* **Due Process**: All parties have the right to present relevant information, receive notice of proceedings, and understand the basis for decisions.

* **Confidentiality**: Information is shared only with those directly involved in the resolution process.

* **Non-Retaliation**: No member of the university community may retaliate against anyone for participating in the grievance process.

* **Evidence-Based Resolution**: Decisions are based on thorough evaluation of available evidence and relevant university policies.

* **Progressive Resolution**: Informal resolution is encouraged before formal processes are initiated.


## Grade Appeal Process

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I appeal a single assignment grade rather than a final course grade?**  
A: The formal grade appeal process applies only to final course grades. Concerns about individual assignments should be addressed directly with the instructor and, if necessary, the department chair through informal processes.

**Q: Will filing a grievance or appeal affect my relationship with my professor or department?**  
A: TUOS strictly prohibits retaliation against students who exercise their right to file grievances or appeals. Any concerns about potential retaliation should be reported immediately to the Dean of Students Office.

**Q: How long do grievance and appeal processes typically take?**  
A: While timelines vary depending on the complexity of the case and the type of grievance, most processes are completed within 30-45 days of initial submission. Expedited processes are available for time-sensitive situations such as those affecting graduation.

**Q: Can I bring someone with me to meetings related to my grievance or appeal?**  
A: Yes, students may bring an advisor or support person to any formal meetings or hearings related to a grievance or appeal. This person may be a fellow student, faculty member, or staff member, but not an attorney unless the case involves potential criminal charges.

**Q: What happens if I miss a deadline for filing an appeal?**  
A: Deadlines are strictly enforced to ensure timely resolution. However, exceptions may be granted in cases of documented extenuating circumstances that prevented timely filing. Requests for deadline extensions must be submitted in writing as soon as possible.
