# Reinstatement & Readmission

## Returning to Your Academic Journey at TUOS

At The University of Ontological Science, we understand that academic journeys are rarely linear. Life circumstances, personal growth, and various challenges may lead students to temporarily step away from their studies. We welcome students seeking to return and continue their intellectual development with us.

## Academic Fresh Start Policy

Students returning after an absence of five or more years may petition for Academic Fresh Start, which allows qualified students to begin a new GPA calculation from the point of readmission. Previous credits earned with a C or better may still apply toward degree requirements, but the previous GPA will not be calculated in the new cumulative GPA.

A: Students seeking reinstatement or readmission must reapply for financial aid. We recommend meeting with a Financial Aid Advisor to discuss your specific situation.
