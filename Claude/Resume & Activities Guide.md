# Resume & Activities Guide

Your resume and list of activities provide valuable insights into your experiences, achievements, and engagement beyond the classroom. At The University of Ontological Science (TUOS), we view these components of your application as an opportunity to gain a more comprehensive understanding of your skills, interests, and potential contributions to our vibrant academic community. The following guide offers strategies and tips to help you craft a compelling resume and activity list that effectively showcases your strengths and experiences.

## Crafting Your Resume

Your resume should provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of your educational background, work experience, skills, and achievements. Consider the following tips as you develop and refine your resume:

1. **Clarity and Organization**: Use clear headers and a logical structure to guide readers through your resume. Organize your content into relevant sections such as Education, Work Experience, Leadership Roles, Volunteer Activities, Skills, and Awards/Honors.

2. **Relevance**: Tailor your resume to highlight experiences and achievements that are most relevant to your academic and professional goals. Prioritize content that demonstrates your fit with TUOS' mission and values, such as interdisciplinary interests, research experience, or community engagement.

3. **Specificity**: Use specific examples and quantifiable achievements to illustrate your skills and impact. Rather than simply listing your responsibilities, highlight the outcomes and results of your efforts. For example, instead of stating "Tutored students in math," you might say "Provided individualized math tutoring to 15 students, resulting in an average grade improvement of 10%."

4. **Action Verbs**: Begin each bullet point with a strong action verb that emphasizes your contributions and leadership. Words like "developed," "initiated," "managed," "analyzed," and "presented" convey a sense of proactivity and engagement.

5. **Formatting**: Use a clear, professional font and consistent formatting throughout your resume. Ensure that your document is easy to read and visually appealing, with appropriate white space and a logical flow of information.

## Highlighting Your Activities

In addition to your resume, TUOS requests a list of your extracurricular activities, volunteer work, and community engagement. This list provides an opportunity to showcase your involvement beyond the classroom and demonstrate your commitment to personal and societal growth. Consider the following strategies as you compile and present your activities:

1. **Significance**: Focus on activities that have been most meaningful and significant to your personal development. Prioritize experiences that demonstrate your leadership, initiative, and impact within your school or community.

2. **Depth over Breadth**: Rather than providing an exhaustive list of every activity you have participated in, focus on those in which you have invested significant time and energy. It is better to showcase a few substantive involvements than a long list of surface-level participations.

3. **Description**: For each activity, provide a brief description that highlights your specific role, contributions, and outcomes. Use action-oriented language to convey your proactivity and engagement.

4. **Thematic Connections**: Look for ways to connect your activities to your academic and professional interests. For example, if you are passionate about environmental sustainability and have volunteered with a local conservation group, highlight how this experience has informed your scholarly pursuits and career goals.

5. **Personal Reflection**: In addition to describing your activities, consider sharing a brief reflection on how these experiences have shaped your personal growth, values, and aspirations. This introspection can provide valuable context for the admissions committee and demonstrate your capacity for self-awareness and reflection.

## Alignment with TUOS Values

As you develop your resume and activity list, keep in mind the core values and mission of TUOS. We are particularly interested in students who demonstrate:

1. **Intellectual Curiosity**: A passion for learning and a willingness to explore new ideas and perspectives across disciplinary boundaries.

2. **Interdisciplinary Engagement**: An interest in integrating insights from multiple fields to address complex questions and problems.

3. **Research and Innovation**: A desire to contribute to the creation of new knowledge and to push the boundaries of what is possible in your chosen field of study.

4. **Personal and Social Responsibility**: A commitment to using your talents and education to make a positive impact in your communities and the world at large.

5. **Collaboration and Leadership**: The ability to work effectively with others, to lead and inspire teams, and to contribute to a vibrant and supportive learning community.

By highlighting experiences and achievements that align with these values, you can demonstrate your fit with the TUOS mission and your potential to thrive in our unique academic environment.
