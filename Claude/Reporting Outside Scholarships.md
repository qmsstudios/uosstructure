# Reporting Outside Scholarships

## Your Responsibility to Report External Awards

At The University of Ontological Science (TUOS), we celebrate your achievement in securing scholarships from external organizations. These additional resources can significantly enhance your educational funding. However, federal regulations require all students to report any outside scholarships or grants they receive to the Financial Aid Office.

## Why You Need to Report Outside Scholarships

- **Federal Compliance:** Federal regulations require that all financial resources be considered when determining your aid eligibility
- **Prevent Over-awarding:** Your total financial aid cannot exceed your cost of attendance
- **Avoid Repayment Issues:** Unreported scholarships discovered later may result in required repayment of other aid
- **Optimize Your Aid Package:** Timely reporting allows us to adjust your aid package in the most beneficial way

## How to Report Outside Scholarships

### Online Reporting (Preferred Method)
1. Log in to the Student Portal at [my.tuos.edu](https://my.tuos.edu)

3. Complete the online form with the following information:
   - Scholarship provider name
   - Scholarship amount
   - Disbursement schedule (one-time or per semester)
   - Any specific conditions of the scholarship

## How Outside Scholarships Affect Your Financial Aid

When we incorporate outside scholarships into your financial aid package, we follow these guidelines:

1. **First, we reduce unmet financial need** (if applicable)
2. **Next, we reduce self-help aid** (loans and work-study)
3. **As a last resort, we reduce institutional grants or scholarships**

This sequence ensures outside scholarships benefit you as much as possible by reducing loan debt before affecting gift aid.

## Scholarship Check Processing

Outside scholarship checks may be:

- **Made payable to TUOS:** Will be directly applied to your student account
- **Made payable to you:** Must be endorsed and submitted to Student Accounts
- **Made co-payable to you and TUOS:** Require your endorsement before processing

Bring or mail all scholarship checks to:
Student Accounts Office
Thompson Hall, Room 110
1000 University Drive
Ontology, ON 12345

## Multi-Year Scholarships

If you've received a multi-year scholarship:
- Report the total award amount
- Indicate the amount expected each year/semester
- Submit updated documentation annually

## Special Situations

### Scholarship Arrives Late
- Contact the Financial Aid Office immediately
- We may be able to make adjustments even after initial disbursement

### Scholarship Amount Changes
- Report any changes to previously reported scholarships

### Scholarship with Specific Requirements

- Some scholarships may restrict how we adjust your aid package
