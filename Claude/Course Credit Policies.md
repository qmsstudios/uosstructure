# Course Credit Policies

The University of Ontological Science maintains comprehensive policies for awarding and evaluating academic credit across our specialized programs in consciousness studies, cognitive science, and interdisciplinary research. These policies ensure consistent standards while recognizing the innovative nature of our academic programs.

## Credit Structure

Academic credit at TUOS reflects the depth and complexity of our specialized coursework. One academic credit typically represents one hour of direct instruction and three hours of independent study per week throughout a semester. This structure accommodates both traditional coursework and research-intensive learning experiences central to our programs.

## Program Requirements

Undergraduate programs require 120 semester credits for graduation, with at least 40 credits in advanced coursework within the student's specialized field of study. Graduate programs typically require 30-60 credits depending on the specific degree and research focus. Doctoral programs emphasize research progression alongside credit completion, requiring significant contributions to consciousness studies or related fields.

## Credit Distribution

Programs balance core requirements with specialized study and research opportunities. Core coursework provides essential foundations in consciousness studies, quantum cognition, and research methodologies. Advanced credits focus on specialized topics and research activities aligned with program objectives and student interests.

## Research Credit

Research activities receive appropriate academic credit reflecting their central role in our programs. Credit allocation considers factors such as research scope, complexity, and contribution to the field. Faculty advisors work with students to determine appropriate credit levels for research projects and ensure alignment with program requirements.

## Independent Study

Independent study credits recognize self-directed learning aligned with program objectives. Students must submit detailed proposals outlining learning goals, methodologies, and expected outcomes. Faculty supervision ensures academic rigor while supporting innovative approaches to specialized topics in consciousness studies and related fields.

## Transfer Credit Evaluation

The university evaluates transfer credits through careful review of course content, learning outcomes, and institutional accreditation. Evaluation considers alignment with TUOS programs and the innovative nature of our specialized fields. Students receive detailed transfer credit evaluations indicating how previous coursework applies to their current program requirements.

## Credit by Examination

Students may earn credit through standardized examinations in appropriate subject areas. The university recognizes various examination programs while maintaining high standards for knowledge demonstration. Credit by examination must align with program requirements and demonstrate mastery of relevant concepts in consciousness studies and related fields.

## Prior Learning Assessment

The university considers prior learning assessment for students with significant professional or research experience in relevant fields. Assessment requires comprehensive documentation demonstrating knowledge alignment with specific course outcomes. Faculty committees evaluate submissions to ensure academic standards while recognizing valuable experience.

## Credit Appeals

Students may appeal credit evaluation decisions through established procedures. Appeals require detailed documentation supporting the request for credit recognition. The academic standards committee reviews appeals thoroughly, considering program requirements and academic standards while maintaining consistent evaluation practices.

## Maximum Credit Loads

Students must maintain appropriate credit loads each semester to ensure academic success. Standard full-time enrollment ranges from 12-15 credits per semester for undergraduates and 9-12 credits for graduate students. Exceptions require academic advisor approval and demonstration of adequate preparation for increased course loads.

## Academic Progress

Credit completion contributes to satisfactory academic progress requirements. Students must complete attempted credits at an appropriate rate while maintaining required grade point averages. Regular progress reviews ensure students advance effectively through their programs while meeting all academic standards.

## Documentation Requirements

The university maintains detailed records of credit awards and evaluations. Students receive regular updates on credit completion status and remaining program requirements. This documentation supports effective academic planning and ensures clear communication about degree progression.
