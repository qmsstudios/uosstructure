# Faculty Grade Submission Guidelines

The University of Ontological Science maintains rigorous academic standards through consistent and fair grading practices. These guidelines ensure timely and accurate grade submission while supporting our commitment to excellence in consciousness studies, cognitive science, and interdisciplinary research.

## Grade Submission Timeline

Faculty must submit final grades within 72 hours after the final examination or last class meeting. This timeline ensures students receive timely feedback on their academic performance while maintaining efficient administrative processes. For courses with significant research components or complex evaluation requirements, faculty should plan evaluation schedules accordingly to meet submission deadlines.

## Grading System Implementation

The university employs a standard letter grade system that reflects the depth of student understanding and achievement. Each grade must align with clear evaluation criteria established in course syllabi. Faculty should maintain detailed documentation of assessment methods and grade calculations throughout the semester.

## Assessment Documentation

Faculty must document their assessment methodology and maintain records of student performance throughout the semester. This documentation includes grading rubrics, assessment criteria, and records of student achievement. Comprehensive documentation supports grade determinations and provides necessary information if grade appeals arise.

## Special Grade Designations

Incomplete Grades
Faculty may assign incomplete grades when students cannot complete coursework due to documented circumstances beyond their control. Incomplete grade contracts must specify remaining requirements and completion deadlines. These contracts require department chair approval and should include detailed plans for course completion.

Research in Progress
Courses involving ongoing research may receive Research in Progress designations when appropriate. These designations require specific documentation of research status and clear criteria for final grade determination. Faculty must monitor progress and convert these designations to standard grades upon research completion.

## Grade Change Procedures

Faculty may initiate grade changes when warranted by computational errors or other documented circumstances. Grade change requests require detailed justification and supporting documentation. The department chair must review and approve all grade changes to ensure adherence to academic policies.

## Evaluation Methods

Faculty should employ diverse assessment methods appropriate to their course content and learning objectives. This includes evaluating theoretical understanding, research capabilities, and practical applications in consciousness studies and related fields. Assessment methods should align with course objectives while maintaining academic rigor.

## Grade Distribution Review

Department chairs conduct regular reviews of grade distributions to ensure consistency and fairness across course sections. Faculty should be prepared to discuss their grading patterns and assessment methods during these reviews. This process maintains academic standards while supporting continuous improvement in evaluation practices.

## Student Performance Documentation

Faculty must maintain clear records of student performance throughout the semester. This documentation includes attendance records, assignment evaluations, and research progress assessments. Comprehensive documentation supports grade determinations and provides necessary information for academic records.

## Academic Integrity Considerations

Faculty must address any academic integrity concerns before submitting final grades. Suspected violations require proper documentation and adherence to university procedures. Grade submissions should reflect appropriate penalties for confirmed violations while maintaining fairness and consistency.

## Technology Requirements

The university's grade submission system requires secure authentication and careful attention to detail. Faculty must verify all entered grades before final submission. The system provides validation checks to ensure accuracy, but faculty remain responsible for grade verification.

## Professional Standards

Grade submission reflects the university's commitment to academic excellence and fairness. Faculty must maintain professional standards throughout the grading process, ensuring equitable evaluation of all students while upholding program-specific academic requirements.
