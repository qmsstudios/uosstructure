# Admission Confirmation & Next Steps

Congratulations on your acceptance to The University of Ontological Science (TUOS)! We are thrilled to welcome you into our vibrant community of scholars and innovators. This page outlines the key steps you need to take to confirm your enrollment and prepare for the start of your academic journey at TUOS.

## Confirming Your Enrollment

To secure your place in the incoming class, you must confirm your enrollment by the deadline indicated in your acceptance letter. To confirm your enrollment:

1. Log in to your TUOS applicant portal using the credentials provided to you.
2. Navigate to the "Enrollment Confirmation" section.
3. Follow the prompts to accept your offer of admission and pay the enrollment deposit.

If you have any issues with the enrollment confirmation process, please contact our admissions office for assistance.

## Registration and Orientation

Once you have confirmed your enrollment, you will need to complete the following steps to register for classes and attend orientation:

1. **Academic Advising**: You will be assigned an academic advisor who will help guide you through the course selection and registration process. Your advisor will reach out to you directly to schedule an advising appointment.

2. **Course Registration**: After meeting with your advisor, you will register for your first semester courses through our online registration system. Detailed instructions on how to access and use the registration system will be provided during your advising appointment.

3. **Orientation**: All incoming students are required to attend a mandatory orientation session prior to the start of the semester. During orientation, you will have the opportunity to meet your classmates, learn about campus resources, and participate in various workshops and activities designed to help you transition into university life. You will receive an email with instructions on how to register for orientation once your enrollment is confirmed.

## Administrative Tasks

In addition to registration and orientation, there are several administrative tasks you need to complete before the start of the semester:

- **Final Transcripts**: If you have not already done so, ensure that your final high school or college transcripts are sent to TUOS. Official transcripts must be received before you can begin classes.

- **Housing**: If you plan to live on campus, you will need to apply for housing through our residential life portal. The housing application will become available once your enrollment is confirmed, and you will receive an email with further instructions.

- **Health Forms**: All students are required to submit a completed health form, including proof of required immunizations, before arriving on campus. The necessary forms and submission instructions will be sent to you via email.

## Preparing for Campus Life

As you look ahead to the start of your TUOS experience, there are a few key things you can do to prepare:

1. **Connect with Your Classmates**: Join the TUOS social media groups for incoming students to start meeting your peers and building a sense of community before you arrive on campus.

2. **Explore Academic Resources**: Familiarize yourself with the academic support resources available at TUOS, including the writing center, tutoring services, and library resources. Taking advantage of these resources from the start will set you up for success.

3. **Get Involved**: Browse the list of student organizations and clubs on the TUOS website and identify a few that align with your interests. Getting involved in extracurricular activities is a great way to make friends and enrich your university experience.

We are excited to have you join the TUOS community and look forward to supporting you as you embark on this transformative intellectual journey. If you have any questions or concerns throughout the enrollment process, please don't hesitate to reach out to our admissions team for guidance.
