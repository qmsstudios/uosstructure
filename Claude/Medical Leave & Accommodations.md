# Medical Leave & Accommodations

## Supporting Your Wellbeing at TUOS

At The University of Ontological Science, we recognize that health challenges can impact a student's academic journey. We are committed to supporting students facing medical and psychological health issues through comprehensive accommodation services and, when necessary, medical leave options. Our goal is to ensure that all students can engage fully with their educational experience while attending to their wellbeing.

## Medical Leave of Absence (MLOA)

A Medical Leave of Absence provides students facing significant health challenges with the opportunity to step away from their studies temporarily to focus on treatment, recovery, and healing.

### Types of Medical Leave

* **Full Medical Leave**: Complete withdrawal from all courses and university activities for one or more semesters
* **Partial Medical Leave**: Reduced course load while maintaining part-time student status
* **Retroactive Medical Leave**: Applied after the fact when health issues have already impacted academic performance

### Eligibility Criteria

Medical Leave is available to students experiencing health conditions that:
* Significantly impact ability to meet academic requirements
* Require intensive treatment or recovery time
* Are documented by qualified healthcare providers
* Cannot be adequately addressed through accommodations alone

### Application Process

1. **Initial Consultation**: Contact the Office of Student Wellbeing to discuss your situation and options
2. **Documentation**: Submit the [Medical Leave Request Form](#) along with supporting documentation from your healthcare provider using the [Medical Documentation Form](#)
3. **Review**: Your request will be evaluated by the Medical Leave Committee, typically within 5-7 business days
4. **Determination**: You will receive written notification of the decision, including any specific conditions for return if the leave is approved
5. **Exit Interview**: Meet with your academic advisor to discuss academic implications and develop a re-entry plan

### Important Considerations

* **Timing**: While MLOA requests can be submitted at any point in the semester, different deadlines affect transcripts and tuition refunds
* **Financial Implications**: Tuition refunds and financial aid adjustments are determined based on the effective date of the leave
* **Housing**: Students in university housing must vacate within 48 hours of leave approval (extensions can be requested)
* **International Students**: F-1/J-1 visa holders should consult with the International Student Office before applying for MLOA
