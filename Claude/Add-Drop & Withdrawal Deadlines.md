## Impact on Academic Standing and Financial Aid

### Academic Impacts

* **Course Completion Rate**: Withdrawals count as attempted but not completed credits, affecting your completion percentage
* **GPA**: Standard "W" grades do not affect GPA, but "WF" grades are calculated as an "F" (0.0)
* **Academic Standing**: Excessive withdrawals may trigger academic warning even with good GPA
* **Prerequisites**: Withdrawn courses do not satisfy prerequisites for advanced courses
* **Repeated Withdrawals**: Three withdrawals from the same course may require department chair approval for fourth attempt

### Financial Aid Considerations

* **Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)**: Withdrawals count against your required completion rate
* **Return of Title IV Funds**: Complete withdrawals before 60% of term may require return of financial aid
* **Scholarship Requirements**: Many scholarships require completing a minimum number of credits
* **Tuition Refunds**: Withdrawals after the add/drop period generally do not qualify for tuition refunds
* **Future Aid Eligibility**: Excessive withdrawals may affect future financial aid eligibility

## Considerations Before Changing Your Schedule

### Before Adding a Course
* Confirm you meet all prerequisites
* Ensure you can manage the additional workload

### Before Dropping or Withdrawing
* Consult with the course instructor about your current standing
* Meet with your academic advisor to discuss degree progress impacts

* Consider using academic support resources instead of withdrawing
* Explore the possibility of an incomplete grade if near term's end

### Alternative Options to Withdrawal
* **Academic Support Services**: Tutoring, writing assistance, study groups
* **Reduced Course Load**: Permission to temporarily drop below full-time with aid protection
* **Incomplete Grade**: Extension to complete coursework (if 70%+ already completed successfully)
* **Pass/Fail Option**: Converting to P/F grading before the deadline (for eligible courses)
* **Academic Coaching**: Personalized support for study skills and time management

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: If I add a course late, will I be penalized for missed assignments?**  
A: This depends on the instructor's policy. Many faculty members work with students to establish reasonable make-up schedules, but you are responsible for all course content regardless of when you add the class. Always communicate promptly with your instructor.

**Q: How many courses can I withdraw from during my time at TUOS?**  
A: While there is no absolute limit, withdrawing from more than two courses per semester or more than six courses during your undergraduate career may trigger additional advising requirements and could impact academic standing.

**Q: Will withdrawing from a course affect my financial aid for the current semester?**  
A: If you maintain at least half-time enrollment (6+ credits for undergraduates, 4.5+ for graduates), withdrawing from a single course typically won't affect current semester aid. However, it may impact future aid eligibility if it lowers your completion rate below SAP requirements.

**Q: Can I add or drop a course after the deadline if I have extenuating circumstances?**  
A: Yes, the Late Add and Late Withdrawal processes exist for this purpose. You'll need to submit the appropriate petition form with documentation of your extenuating circumstances for committee review.

**Q: If I withdraw from a course, will I receive a tuition refund?**  
A: No refund is provided for course withdrawals after the add/drop period. You remain financially responsible for the full cost of the course. Refunds are only available for courses dropped during the add/drop period.

**Q: How do I know if withdrawing is the right decision?**  
A: Schedule a meeting with your academic advisor to discuss your specific situation. They can help you weigh the pros and cons of withdrawing versus continuing and connect you with appropriate resources.
