## Accessing Disability Services

The Office of Disability & Accessibility Services is located in Franklin Hall, Room 103, in a fully accessible location central to campus. Office hours are Monday through Friday, 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM, with extended hours available by appointment. Virtual appointments are also available for students who prefer remote access.

To register for services, begin by completing the confidential registration form available at accessibility.tuos.edu. Following submission, you'll be contacted to schedule an intake appointment with an Accessibility Specialist who will guide you through the interactive accommodation process.

We encourage students to initiate the accommodation process as early as possible, ideally at least four weeks before accommodations are needed. However, we recognize that disability can be acquired at any time, and we accept accommodation requests throughout the year.

For questions about accommodations or accessibility, contact the office at access@tuos.edu or call 555-123-4567. For immediate assistance with urgent accessibility concerns, call our Accessibility Hotline at 555-987-6543.

At TUOS, we view accessibility not merely as a legal obligation but as a fundamental aspect of our commitment to equity, inclusion, and academic excellence. By ensuring that all students can fully participate in our intellectual community, we enrich the depth and breadth of our collective inquiry into the nature of consciousness, reality, and human experience.
