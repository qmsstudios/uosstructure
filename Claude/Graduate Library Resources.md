## Accessing Library Resources

The Graduate Research Library is located in the Husserl Building and is open to graduate students 24 hours a day with your student ID. The main service desk is staffed Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM, and Saturday from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM.

All electronic resources can be accessed off-campus through the library portal (library.tuos.edu) using your university credentials. For specialized research needs, subject librarians are available for scheduled consultations in person or virtually.

New graduate students are strongly encouraged to schedule a Research Orientation Consultation within their first semester to become familiar with the specific resources most relevant to their research interests. These personalized sessions can be scheduled through the online appointment system on the library website.

At TUOS, we view the library not as a passive repository but as an active research partner and collaborative space where the pursuit of ontological understanding is supported, enriched, and preserved. The resources, services, and environments of the TUOS Libraries are continually evolving to support the sophisticated and challenging nature of research in consciousness, reality, and the fundamental questions of existence.
