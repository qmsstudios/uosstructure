# Tuition Refund Schedule

## Financial Policies for Course Adjustments and Withdrawals

At The University of Ontological Science, we understand that circumstances may necessitate changes to your academic plans after enrollment. Our tuition refund schedule is designed to provide clear guidelines regarding financial adjustments when students withdraw from courses or take leaves of absence. TUOS is committed to transparent financial policies that balance institutional responsibilities with student needs during academic transitions.

* All withdrawals and course drops must be officially processed through the Registrar's Office to be eligible for refunds
* Refund percentages apply to tuition and the comprehensive fee only; other fees may be non-refundable as noted below
* Different refund schedules apply depending on the academic term (Fall/Spring, Summer, Winter) and program type
* Financial aid recipients should consult with the Financial Aid Office before withdrawing, as refunds may affect aid eligibility

## Impact on Financial Aid

Withdrawing from courses may have significant implications for your financial aid:

* **Federal Title IV Aid**: Subject to Return to Title IV (R2T4) calculation, potentially requiring repayment of "unearned" aid
* **Satisfactory Academic Progress**: Withdrawals may affect future aid eligibility
* **Scholarships and Grants**: May be reduced or canceled based on enrollment status changes
* **Loan Repayment**: Withdrawing completely may trigger the start of your loan grace period

All financial aid recipients should consult with a Financial Aid Counselor before withdrawing from any courses.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: If I drop one course but remain enrolled in others, am I eligible for a partial tuition refund?**  
A: For full-time students, dropping a course without falling below full-time status (12 credits) typically does not result in a refund. Part-time students who pay per credit will receive refunds according to the schedule when reducing their course load.

**Q: How do room and board refunds work if I withdraw mid-semester?**  
A: Room refunds follow the tuition refund percentage schedule. Board (meal plan) refunds are prorated on a weekly basis from the official withdrawal date, regardless of actual meal plan usage.

**Q: If my financial aid covered my tuition, who receives the refund if I withdraw?**  
A: When financial aid has been applied to your account, refunds first go toward repaying the aid programs according to federal, state, and institutional guidelines. Any remaining balance would then be refunded to you.

**Q: What if I need to withdraw after the refund period due to a serious emergency?**  
A: For withdrawals after the refund period, you may submit an appeal through the Tuition Appeal Committee if you experienced a serious emergency, documented medical issue, or other extenuating circumstance.

**Q: How do refunds work for study abroad programs?**  
A: Study abroad programs follow program-specific refund policies, which are often more restrictive due to advance payments to partner institutions. These policies are provided during the application process.
