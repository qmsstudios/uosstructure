# How to Maintain Aid Eligibility

## Keeping Your Financial Support Active

To retain financial aid eligibility, students must meet certain academic and enrollment criteria. This section outlines the requirements for maintaining aid eligibility, including maintaining a specific GPA, completing a minimum number of credit hours, and adhering to academic progress standards.

## Academic Requirements

### Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)
All students receiving financial aid must maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress:

- **Minimum GPA Requirement**
  - Undergraduate students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher
  - Some scholarships may require higher GPAs (typically 3.0 or above)
  - GPA is evaluated at the end of each semester

- **Course Completion Rate**
  - You must successfully complete at least 67% of all attempted credit hours
  - Example: If you attempt 30 credits in an academic year, you must successfully complete at least 20 credits
  - Withdrawals, incompletes, and failed courses count as attempted but not completed

- **Maximum Timeframe**
  - You must complete your degree within 150% of the published program length
  - For a typical 120-credit bachelor's degree, this means attempting no more than 180 credits
  - Transfer credits count toward this maximum

### Impact of Grades and Course Completion
Different grade outcomes affect your aid eligibility:

- **Passing Grades** (A, B, C, D): Count as completed credits
- **Failing Grades** (F): Count as attempted but not completed
- **Withdrawals** (W): Count as attempted but not completed
- **Incompletes** (I): Initially count as attempted but not completed
- **Repeated Courses**: May be funded for a maximum of two attempts
