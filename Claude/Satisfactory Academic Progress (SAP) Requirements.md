# Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Requirements

## Overview

At The University of Ontological Science (TUOS), we are committed to supporting our students on their academic journey while maintaining high standards of educational achievement. Our Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy ensures that students are making meaningful progress toward completing their degree programs. These standards align with federal regulations and reflect our academic philosophy of continuous growth and development.

## SAP Standards

All students at TUOS must meet the following SAP requirements to maintain eligibility for financial aid and continue in their programs:

### 1. Qualitative Measure (GPA Requirements)

- Undergraduate students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 (C average)
- Graduate students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 (B average)
- Doctoral candidates must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.3

### 2. Quantitative Measure (Pace of Completion)

Students must successfully complete at least 67% of all attempted credit hours. This is calculated by dividing the total number of hours successfully completed by the total number of hours attempted.

- Completed credits: Courses with grades of A, B, C, D, or P
- Attempted but not completed: Courses with grades of F, W (withdrawal), I (incomplete)
- Repeated courses count as attempted credits each time they are taken

### 3. Maximum Timeframe

Students must complete their degree program within 150% of the published length of the program:

- Bachelor's degrees (120 credit hours): Maximum 180 attempted credit hours
- Master's degrees (36 credit hours): Maximum 54 attempted credit hours
- Doctoral programs (72 credit hours): Maximum 108 attempted credit hours

## SAP Evaluation Timeline

- SAP is evaluated at the end of each semester (Fall, Spring, and Summer)
- Students are notified via their TUOS email account if they fail to meet SAP requirements
- New students are evaluated after completing their first semester at TUOS

## SAP Statuses

### Good Standing
Students who meet all SAP criteria are considered in good academic standing.

### Warning
Students who fail to meet SAP standards for the first time will be placed on SAP Warning for the following semester. During this period:
- Students remain eligible for financial aid
- Students must meet with their academic advisor to develop an improvement plan
- Students return to Good Standing if they meet all SAP requirements by the end of the Warning semester

### Suspension
Students who fail to meet SAP requirements after a Warning semester will be placed on SAP Suspension. During this period:
- Students are ineligible for financial aid
- Students may continue enrollment by paying out-of-pocket
- Students may appeal their suspension status (see Appeal Process below)

### Probation
Students with approved SAP appeals will be placed on SAP Probation for one semester. During this period:
- Students regain financial aid eligibility
- Students must follow an Academic Plan developed with their advisor
- Students who meet SAP requirements at the end of the Probation semester return to Good Standing
- Students who do not meet SAP requirements but fulfill their Academic Plan may continue on Probation

## Appeal Process

Students who have experienced extenuating circumstances that affected their academic performance may submit a SAP Appeal:

1. **Complete the SAP Appeal Form** (available through the Student Portal)
2. **Submit documentation** supporting the extenuating circumstances (medical records, death certificates, etc.)
3. **Develop an Academic Plan** with your academic advisor outlining how you will achieve SAP requirements
4. **Submit all materials** to the Office of Academic Affairs by the deadline (two weeks before the start of the next semester)

### Valid Appeal Reasons
- Serious illness or injury of the student
- Death or serious illness of an immediate family member
- Significant traumatic events
- Other documented extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control

Appeals are reviewed by the SAP Appeals Committee, and decisions are communicated within 10 business days of submission.

## Reinstatement

Students who have lost financial aid eligibility due to SAP Suspension may restore their eligibility by:

1. **Successfully appealing** their SAP Suspension
2. **Taking courses without financial aid** until they meet all SAP requirements
3. **Sitting out for at least one semester** and then appealing for reinstatement

## Academic Dismissal

Students who fail to meet SAP requirements for three consecutive semesters may face Academic Dismissal from TUOS. Students facing dismissal will be notified by the Dean of Academic Affairs and have the right to a final appeal.
