## Accessing Research Tools

Most citation and research tools are available through institutional subscriptions accessible via the Research Tools Portal at tools.tuos.edu. Many applications offer both web-based access and downloadable desktop versions for offline use.

The Library's Research Technology Center (located in the Merleau-Ponty Building, Room 302) provides dedicated workstations with all supported research tools pre-installed and configured. Technology specialists are available Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, for hands-on assistance with tool selection and implementation.

Monthly workshops on various research tools are offered through the Graduate Research Skills Program. The schedule and registration information can be found on the Library website at library.tuos.edu/workshops.

For individual assistance with selecting or using research tools, schedule a consultation with the Research Technology Librarian at libtech@tuos.edu or through the appointment system on the Library website.

## Strategic Implementation

Rather than attempting to master all available tools simultaneously, we recommend a strategic approach to research technology adoption:

1. **Foundation Stage**: Begin with a citation management system and basic organizational tools that integrate well with your writing process

2. **Discovery Enhancement**: Add specialized search tools and alerts relevant to your specific research interests

3. **Analysis Expansion**: Incorporate analytical tools as your research progresses and specific needs emerge

4. **Collaboration Integration**: Adopt team-based tools as collaborative projects develop

5. **Dissemination Focus**: Implement visualization and presentation tools as you prepare to share your research

At TUOS, we view research tools not merely as conveniences but as extensions of your scholarly thinking—technologies that can enhance your cognitive processes, strengthen your methodological rigor, and amplify the impact of your contributions to ontological understanding. By thoughtfully integrating these resources into your research practice, you establish a foundation for sustained intellectual productivity and innovative scholarship.
