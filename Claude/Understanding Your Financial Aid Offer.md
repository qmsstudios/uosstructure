## Managing Your Financial Aid

### Disbursement Process
- Financial aid is typically disbursed at the beginning of each semester
- Aid is first applied to direct costs (tuition, fees, on-campus housing and meal plans)
- Any remaining funds are refunded to you for other educational expenses
- Disbursement dates are listed in the academic calendar
- You can track the status of your aid disbursement in the student portal

### Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)
To maintain eligibility for financial aid, you must:
- Maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0
- Successfully complete at least 67% of attempted credits
- Complete your degree program within 150% of the published timeframe
- SAP is evaluated at the end of each semester
- Students not meeting SAP standards receive a warning or may lose eligibility

### Responsible Borrowing
