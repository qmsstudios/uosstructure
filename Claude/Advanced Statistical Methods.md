## Accessing Statistical Support and Resources

The Statistical Methods Center is located in Wittgenstein Hall, Room 305, and offers services Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Statistical consultants are available by appointment, which can be scheduled through the Graduate Portal or by emailing stats@tuos.edu.

Software and computing resources are accessible through the Statistical Computing Lab (Wittgenstein Hall, Room 310) and remotely via the TUOS Virtual Computing Environment. All major statistical software packages are available on lab computers and through virtual desktop access.

For new graduate students, we recommend:
1. Attending the "Statistical Methods Orientation" workshop offered at the beginning of each semester
2. Scheduling an initial consultation to discuss your research interests and statistical needs
3. Joining at least one statistical methods working group related to your research area
4. Exploring the online Statistical Methods Resource Library for self-paced learning materials

At TUOS, we view advanced statistical methods not as separate from philosophical inquiry but as complementary tools that expand our capacity to investigate complex questions about consciousness, reality, and human experience. Whether you're developing a mixed-methods dissertation, analyzing experimental data, or testing theoretical models, these quantitative approaches can strengthen the rigor and impact of your ontological research.
