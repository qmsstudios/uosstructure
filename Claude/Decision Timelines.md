# Decision Timelines at The University of Ontological Science

At The University of Ontological Science (TUOS), we understand that the admissions process can be a stressful and uncertain time for applicants. To help alleviate some of this uncertainty, we provide clear and transparent decision timelines for our various application pathways. These timelines are designed to give applicants a strong sense of when they can expect to receive updates on their application status, allowing them to plan accordingly.

## Early Decision Timeline
For applicants who have selected TUOS as their top choice institution and are committed to attending if admitted, we offer an Early Decision application option. The timeline for Early Decision is as follows:

- Application Deadline: November 15
- Notification of Decision: December 15
- Enrollment Confirmation Deadline: January 1

Applicants who are admitted through the Early Decision process are required to withdraw their applications from all other institutions and submit their enrollment confirmation by the January 1 deadline.

## Regular Decision Timeline
The majority of our applicants apply through our Regular Decision process. This timeline provides ample time for applicants to compile a strong application and carefully consider their options. The Regular Decision timeline is as follows:

- Application Deadline: January 15
- Notification of Decision: March 30
- Enrollment Confirmation Deadline: May 1

We make every effort to release all Regular Decision notifications by the March 30 date. In some cases, particularly for applicants who are being considered for specialized programs or scholarships, the notification timeline may be extended slightly. In such cases, we will communicate directly with the affected applicants.

## Next Steps After Admission
Once applicants receive an offer of admission from TUOS, there are several important next steps to complete the enrollment process:

1. **Enrollment Confirmation:** Admitted students must submit their enrollment confirmation and pay the enrollment deposit by the deadline corresponding to their application type (January 1 for Early Decision, May 1 for Regular Decision).

2. **Financial Aid:** Admitted students who have applied for financial aid will receive their aid offer shortly after receiving their offer of admission. They should carefully review this offer and follow the instructions provided to accept their aid package.

3. **Orientation Registration:** All admitted students are required to attend a New Student Orientation session prior to the start of their first semester. Registration for orientation typically opens in April, and students will receive detailed instructions on how to register at that time.

4. **Course Registration:** New students will register for their first semester courses during their orientation session. Prior to orientation, students should review the academic requirements for their intended major and start considering potential course options.

We know that the admissions process can feel daunting at times, but we are here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions about our decision timelines or the steps you need to take after being admitted, please don't hesitate to reach out to our admissions team for guidance.
