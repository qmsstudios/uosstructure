# Part-Time vs Full-Time Status

The University of Ontological Science recognizes that students pursue their academic goals under varying circumstances and commitments. Understanding the distinctions between part-time and full-time enrollment helps students make informed decisions about their academic progression while maintaining compliance with university and program requirements.

## Enrollment Classifications

### Full-Time Status

Undergraduate students maintain full-time status by enrolling in 12 or more credit hours per semester. Graduate students achieve full-time status with 9 or more credit hours per semester. Doctoral candidates engaged in dissertation research may maintain full-time status through research credit enrollment as specified by their program requirements.

### Part-Time Status

Undergraduate students enrolled in fewer than 12 credit hours per semester are classified as part-time. Graduate students taking fewer than 9 credit hours maintain part-time status. This classification provides flexibility for students balancing academic pursuits with professional or personal commitments.

## Academic Progress Expectations

Part-time students must demonstrate consistent progress toward degree completion, though at a modified pace. The university expects all students, regardless of enrollment status, to maintain the academic standards necessary for their program of study in consciousness research, cognitive science, or related fields.

## Program Completion Timeframes

Part-time enrollment extends the typical timeframe for program completion. Undergraduate programs typically require additional semesters beyond the standard four-year timeline. Graduate students must complete their programs within the maximum time limits established by their academic department, even when studying part-time.

## Financial Considerations

### Tuition and Fees

The university calculates tuition on a per-credit basis, ensuring equitable charges regardless of enrollment status. Some university fees may vary based on part-time or full-time classification. Students should review the complete fee structure when planning their enrollment.

### Financial Aid Impact

Enrollment status significantly affects financial aid eligibility. Full-time students typically qualify for the maximum available aid, while part-time students receive prorated amounts based on their credit hours. Some scholarships and grants require maintenance of full-time status.

## Academic Resources

All students, whether part-time or full-time, receive full access to university academic resources, including research facilities, libraries, and laboratory spaces. This ensures consistent support for academic achievement regardless of enrollment status.

## Research Participation

Part-time students maintain eligibility for research participation, though they should carefully coordinate their involvement with credit hour limitations. Faculty advisors help students structure research activities appropriately for their enrollment status.

## Enrollment Status Changes

Students may change their enrollment status between semesters based on their academic needs and personal circumstances. Such changes require careful consideration of academic progress requirements and consultation with academic advisors to ensure appropriate planning.

## Program-Specific Requirements

Some specialized programs in consciousness studies and quantum cognition may have specific enrollment status requirements. Students should consult their program handbook and academic advisor regarding any limitations on part-time study within their chosen field.

## International Student Considerations

International students must maintain full-time enrollment to comply with visa requirements, except in specific, documented circumstances. The university provides guidance through international student services to ensure compliance while supporting academic success.

## Student Services Access

Both part-time and full-time students receive access to essential university services, including academic advising, career counseling, and technical support. This comprehensive support ensures all students can pursue their academic goals effectively regardless of enrollment status.

## Employment Considerations

Part-time enrollment often accommodates concurrent employment. The university's innovative course scheduling and research opportunities support students maintaining professional commitments while advancing their academic studies in consciousness research and related fields.
