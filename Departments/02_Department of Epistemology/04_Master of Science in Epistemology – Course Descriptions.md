## **Core Courses (24 credits):**

1. ### **EPI 501 – Foundations of Epistemological Theory**

Introduction to the foundational concepts of epistemology, focusing on the nature of knowledge, belief, and truth. This course surveys classical and contemporary theories of knowledge. Students will engage with primary texts and critical essays to understand the evolution of epistemological thought and its relevance to contemporary issues.

2. ### **EPI 502 – Knowledge, Belief, and Justification**

Exploration of key concepts in epistemology, including different forms of justification and the relationship between belief and knowledge. Emphasis on internalism, externalism, and foundationalism. The course includes case studies and thought experiments to illustrate how these concepts apply in various contexts, from everyday reasoning to scientific inquiry.

3. ### **EPI 503 – Rationalism, Empiricism, and Constructivism**

Comparative study of major epistemological schools of thought, analyzing rationalist, empiricist, and constructivist approaches to knowledge. Students will critically examine the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and their implications for understanding human cognition and the acquisition of knowledge.

4. ### **EPI 504 – Epistemology in Science and Technology**

Examination of how epistemological concepts are applied in science and technology. This course covers scientific realism, paradigms, and the role of epistemic values in scientific inquiry. Students will analyze historical and contemporary case studies to understand how epistemological issues influence scientific practice and technological innovation.

5. ### **EPI 505 – Cognitive Epistemology: Perception and Reality**

Study of how cognitive processes influence our understanding of knowledge. Topics include perceptual theories, cognitive biases, and the epistemic implications of cognitive science. The course will involve interdisciplinary readings and discussions, integrating insights from psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy.

6. ### **EPI 506 – Applied Epistemology in Decision-Making**

Application of epistemological principles to decision-making in real-world contexts. Focus on uncertainty, probability, and the role of evidence in rational choice theory. Students will learn to apply epistemological frameworks to practical problems in areas such as policy-making, business strategy, and personal decision-making.

7. ### **EPI 699 – Capstone Research in Epistemology**

A culminating research project where students explore an original epistemological question. The capstone involves independent research, resulting in a thesis that advances understanding in the field of epistemology. Students will work closely with a faculty advisor to develop their research question, methodology, and analysis, culminating in a formal presentation of their findings.
