The Doctor of Philosophy in Decision Theory is an advanced, research-driven program that explores the principles, models, and cognitive processes underlying decision-making in complex environments. This interdisciplinary program combines behavioral decision science, probabilistic reasoning, and ethics to provide a comprehensive understanding of how decisions are made, optimized, and influenced across multiple domains.

Doctoral candidates will engage in rigorous academic research, focusing on advanced decision models, game theory, and ethical frameworks in decision-making. This program prepares students to contribute original research and innovative applications in the field of decision science, with implications for economics, artificial intelligence, and public policy.

## **About the Program**

The Ph.D. in  Decision Theory offers a deep exploration of decision models, probabilistic reasoning, and behavioral insights in decision-making. Students will analyze how decisions are shaped by cognitive processes, strategic interactions, and ethical considerations. The program emphasizes both theoretical foundations and applied research, providing students with the tools to develop decision-support systems and optimize decision outcomes.

Through advanced coursework and original research, students will explore topics such as multi-criteria decision analysis, Bayesian networks, and game theory while focusing on their real-world applications in business, policy, and technology.

Doctoral candidates will conduct independent research culminating in a dissertation that contributes new insights to the field of decision theory.

## **Key Areas of Study**

- Advanced Rational Choice and Utility Models
- Game Theory and Strategic Decision Models
- Behavioral Decision Science and Cognitive Bias Analysis
- Probabilistic Models and Bayesian Networks
- Ethics and Decision-Making in Complex Systems

## **Who Should Enroll?**

This program is ideal for decision scientists, behavioral economists, AI specialists, and researchers interested in decision-making frameworks. Whether pursuing academic research or applied roles in policy analysis, business strategy, or artificial intelligence, this program equips graduates with the expertise to lead and innovate in decision science.
