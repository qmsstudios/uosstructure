## **Core Courses (18 credits):**

1. ### **EPI 701 – Advanced Epistemological Theory**

This course offers an in-depth exploration of both classical and contemporary epistemological theories. Students will engage with key texts and debates surrounding the nature of knowledge, justification, and belief. The course will cover foundational theories as well as recent advancements and ongoing discussions in the field, providing a comprehensive understanding of epistemology.

2. ### **EPI 702 – Rationality and Belief Systems**

In this course, students will study the concept of rationality and the processes involved in belief formation. The course will examine various belief systems and how they influence reasoning and decision-making. Topics include the analysis of rational versus irrational beliefs, the impact of cognitive biases, and the role of evidence in shaping belief structures.

3. ### **EPI 703 – Social Epistemology and Collective Knowledge**

This course examines knowledge as a social construct, focusing on how collective processes contribute to the formation and validation of knowledge. Students will explore topics such as peer disagreement, the dynamics of collective intelligence, and the functioning of epistemic communities. The course will also address the implications of social epistemology for public discourse and policy-making.

4. ### **EPI 704 – Experimental and Applied Epistemology**

Students in this course will investigate the use of experimental methods in epistemology and their application to real-world problems. The course emphasizes empirical research and the practical application of epistemic principles. Topics include designing and conducting epistemological experiments, analyzing data, and applying findings to areas such as education, science, and public policy.

5. ### **EPI 705 – Epistemic Logic and Modalities of Belief**

This course focuses on the study of epistemic logic and its applications in modeling knowledge and belief states. Students will learn about various logical systems used to represent epistemic concepts, such as knowledge, belief, and doubt. The course will cover the formal properties of these systems and their use in analyzing complex epistemic scenarios.

6. ### **EPI 706 – Epistemology in Science and Technology**

In this course, students will analyze the intersection between epistemology, science, and technology. The course will cover epistemic frameworks used in scientific inquiry and technological innovation, examining how these frameworks influence the development and validation of scientific knowledge. Topics include the role of models and simulations, the impact of technological advancements on epistemic practices, and the ethical implications of scientific and technological progress.

## **Research & Dissertation (12 Credits)**

1. ### **EPI 800 – Dissertation Proposal Seminar** (3 credits)

This seminar is designed to help students develop a dissertation proposal that addresses an original epistemological question. Students will receive guidance on formulating research questions, conducting literature reviews, and designing research methodologies. The course will also cover the process of writing and presenting a proposal, with feedback from peers and faculty.

2. ### **EPI 801 – Dissertation Research I** (3 credits)

In this course, students will engage in independent research focused on empirical, theoretical, or applied epistemological studies. Students will work closely with their dissertation advisors to develop their research projects, collect and analyze data, and begin drafting their dissertation chapters.

3. ### **EPI 802 – Dissertation Research II** (3 credits)

This course is a continuation of Dissertation Research I, where students will synthesize their research findings and continue writing their dissertation. The course will provide support for refining research methodologies, addressing challenges, and preparing for the final stages of the dissertation process.

4. ### **EPI 803 – Dissertation Defense** (3 credits)

In this course, students will present and defend their doctoral dissertation before a committee of faculty members. The defense will involve a thorough examination of the student's research, methodology, and contributions to the field of epistemology. Students must demonstrate a significant and original contribution to the discipline to successfully complete the course.
