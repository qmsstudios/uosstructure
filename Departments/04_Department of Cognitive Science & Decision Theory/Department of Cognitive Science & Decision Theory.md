The Department of Cognitive Science & Decision Theory at the University of Ontological Science (UOS) is dedicated to the exploration of cognition, intelligence, and the mechanisms underlying thought, decision-making, and perception. This department integrates **Cognitive Science**, **Decision Theory**, and **Quantum Cognition**, creating a comprehensive academic foundation that merges theoretical cognitive science, computational modeling, and the study of cognitive systems.

Cognition is at the core of human experience, governing reasoning, memory, problem-solving, and decision-making. Traditional cognitive science has focused on neuroscience, psychology, and computational models of thought, but emerging disciplines such as quantum cognition and decision theory have revolutionized our understanding of how cognition operates at both conscious and non-conscious levels.

The Department of Cognitive Science & Decision Theory takes a multidisciplinary approach, drawing from philosophy, psychology, artificial intelligence, and quantum theory, to explore how cognitive structures form, interact, and influence behavior. This integration allows students to engage with both classical cognitive models and modern computational techniques, ensuring a holistic understanding of cognitive science, decision theory, and advanced reasoning systems.

### **Bridging Classical Cognitive Science and Quantum Theories of Mind**

Cognitive science has traditionally examined information processing, pattern recognition, and problem-solving, while decision theory focuses on strategic reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty. The Department of Cognitive Science & Decision Theory explores these frameworks, emphasizing the role of probabilistic reasoning, cognitive modeling, and computational strategies for decision optimization.

Additionally, decision theory applies structured models to artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and strategic analysis, ensuring that the study of cognition is not just theoretical but applicable to intelligent systems, behavioral modeling, and decision-making processes.

Graduates from this department develop expertise in both traditional and quantum-based cognitive models, positioning them for careers in research, AI development, decision science, cognitive modeling, and knowledge engineering.
