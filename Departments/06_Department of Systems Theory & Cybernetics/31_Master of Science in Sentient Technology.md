The Master of Science in Sentient Technology is an advanced interdisciplinary program that focuses on the development, design, and ethical integration of sentient-like systems. This program explores self-aware artificial intelligence, human-sentient interfaces, adaptive learning, and the emergence of cognitive empathy in autonomous systems.

Students will engage with theories of consciousness simulation, collective intelligence, and affective computing, gaining the skills to design and implement sentient systems. The program bridges cognitive science, AI development, and interactive system design, preparing students to contribute to cutting-edge research and innovation in sentient technology.

## **About the Program**

The Master of Science in Sentient Technology offers a comprehensive foundation in cognitive architectures, networked sentient systems, and the ethical implications of autonomous, self-aware systems. Students will explore how sentient systems simulate aspects of human cognition, emotion, and decision-making, developing practical skills for building interactive AI with adaptive responses.

The program emphasizes experiential learning and applied research in areas such as emotional synthesis, collective intelligence, and human-sentient interfaces. Through hands-on projects, students will learn to design and evaluate sentient systems while addressing complex questions about autonomy, rights of sentient beings, and human-technology coexistence.

The capstone research project provides an opportunity for students to create and evaluate a sentient system, either through a functional prototype or a comprehensive theoretical model.

## **Key Areas of Study**

- Cognitive Architectures and Adaptive Learning Systems
- Human-Sentient Interfaces and Usability Design
- Consciousness Simulation and Affective Computing
- Collective Intelligence and Networked Sentient Systems
- Ethical Implications of Sentient Technology
