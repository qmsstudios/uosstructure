## **Core Courses (18 credits):**

1. ### **CO 701 – Advanced Computational Ontology**

In-depth study of computational ontology principles and algorithms. Emphasis on semantic reasoning, ontology-driven data integration, and advanced modeling techniques. Students will engage in hands-on projects to develop and implement ontological models, and explore case studies demonstrating the application of computational ontology in various domains.

2. ### **CO 702 – Ontology-Based Knowledge Representation**

Exploration of ontology-based approaches for representing and managing complex knowledge systems. Focus on description logics and semantic networks. The course includes practical exercises in building and querying ontologies, and discussions on the challenges and best practices in knowledge representation.

3. ### **CO 703 – Semantic Data Integration and Interoperability**

Study of semantic data integration techniques. Topics include ontology alignment, data harmonization, and interoperability across heterogeneous systems. Students will work on real-world data integration projects, learning to use tools and frameworks for achieving semantic interoperability.

4. ### **CO 704 – Machine Reasoning and Automated Inference**

Investigation of machine reasoning and automated inference within computational ontology systems. Applications in AI-driven decision support are emphasized. The course covers various reasoning algorithms, their implementation, and evaluation, with practical assignments to develop automated inference systems.

5. ### **CO 705 – Natural Language Processing and Computational Semantics**

Examination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for computational semantics and ontology-based text analysis. Students will explore NLP tools and techniques, participate in projects involving text mining and semantic analysis, and study the integration of NLP with ontological frameworks.

6. ### **CO 706 – AI Ontologies and Autonomous Systems**

Study of AI ontologies and their application in autonomous systems. Topics include ontological frameworks for robotics and intelligent agents. The course involves designing and implementing ontologies for autonomous systems, with case studies on their use in real-world applications such as robotics, smart environments, and intelligent agents.

## **Research & Dissertation (12 Credits)**

1. ### **CO 800 – Dissertation Proposal Seminar** (3 credits)

Development of a dissertation proposal focused on an original contribution to computational ontology. Students will present their proposals, receive feedback, and refine their research questions and methodologies. The seminar includes workshops on research design, literature review, and proposal writing.

2. ### **CO 801 – Dissertation Research I** (3 credits)

Independent research under faculty supervision, with a focus on computational models and applied ontology. Students will conduct preliminary experiments, gather data, and begin the analysis phase of their research. Regular meetings with advisors ensure progress and provide guidance.

3. ### **CO 802 – Dissertation Research II** (3 credits)

Continuation of dissertation research, synthesizing results and preparing for the final dissertation. Students will complete their data analysis, write up their findings, and prepare for the dissertation defense. Emphasis is placed on producing a high-quality, publishable dissertation.

4. ### **CO 803 – Dissertation Defense** (3 credits)

Formal dissertation defense. Students must demonstrate innovative contributions to computational ontology. The defense includes a public presentation of the research, followed by a question-and-answer session with the dissertation committee. Successful defense leads to the awarding of the doctoral degree.
