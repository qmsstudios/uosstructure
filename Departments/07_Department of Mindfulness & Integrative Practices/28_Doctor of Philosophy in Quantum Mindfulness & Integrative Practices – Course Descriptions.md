## **Core Courses (18 credits):**

1. ### **QMI 701 – Foundations of Quantum Mind Theory**

Advanced exploration of Quantum Mind Theory, focusing on psychodynamic dimensions, cognitive superposition, and quantum-based cognitive optimization. This course will delve into the theoretical underpinnings of Quantum Mind Theory, examining how quantum mechanics principles can be applied to understand cognitive processes. Students will engage with cutting-edge research and case studies to explore the implications of quantum theory on mental health and cognitive enhancement.

2. ### **QMI 702 – Non-Local Cognition and Expanded Awareness**

Study of non-local cognitive phenomena and their relationship to expanded states of awareness in Quantum Mindfulness practices. The course will cover the concept of non-locality in quantum physics and its parallels in cognitive science. Students will learn techniques to cultivate expanded awareness and apply these practices to enhance mindfulness and cognitive performance.

3. ### **QMI 703 – Cognitive Wave Theory and Emotional Regulation**

Investigation of cognitive wave theory and its application in emotional regulation and cognitive flexibility within mindfulness-based frameworks. This course will explore the oscillatory nature of cognitive processes and how these can be harnessed to regulate emotions. Students will practice mindfulness techniques designed to promote cognitive flexibility and emotional resilience.

4. ### **QMI 704 – Energy Dynamics and Psychodynamic Collapse**

Exploration of energy dynamics in the mind and the concept of psychodynamic collapse as a mechanism for cognitive integration and transformation. The course will examine the flow of mental energy and how disruptions can lead to psychodynamic collapse. Students will learn strategies to manage energy dynamics and facilitate cognitive integration for personal growth.

5. ### **QMI 705 – Integrative Practices for Mindful Leadership and Resilience**

Application of Quantum Mindfulness principles in leadership, resilience training, and personal development. This course will provide students with tools to apply mindfulness in leadership roles, fostering resilience and effective decision-making. Practical exercises and case studies will illustrate how Quantum Mindfulness can enhance leadership capabilities and personal development.

6. ### **QMI 706 – Multidimensional Awareness and Conscious Intent**

Study of multidimensional awareness and the role of conscious intent in shaping cognitive states and psychodynamic outcomes. The course will explore how awareness extends beyond the physical realm and how conscious intent can influence cognitive and emotional states. Students will engage in practices to develop multidimensional awareness and apply these insights to achieve desired psychodynamic outcomes.

## **Research & Dissertation (12 Credits)**

1. ### **QMI 800 – Dissertation Proposal Seminar** (3 credits)

Development of a dissertation proposal on a topic within Quantum Mindfulness. Focus on integrating theoretical and applied aspects of the discipline. Students will receive guidance on formulating research questions, conducting literature reviews, and designing research methodologies. The seminar will culminate in the submission of a comprehensive dissertation proposal.

2. ### **QMI 801 – Dissertation Research I** (3 credits)

Independent research under faculty supervision, focusing on a specific area of Quantum Mindfulness. Students will conduct original research, collect and analyze data, and begin drafting their dissertation. Regular meetings with faculty advisors will ensure progress and provide support throughout the research process.

3. ### **QMI 802 – Dissertation Research II** (3 credits)

Continuation of dissertation research, refining findings and preparing the final dissertation. Students will continue their research efforts, addressing any challenges and refining their analysis. The course will emphasize the importance of critical thinking and scholarly writing in preparing a high-quality dissertation.

4. ### **QMI 803 – Dissertation Defense** (3 credits)

Formal presentation and defense of the dissertation. Students must demonstrate original contributions to the field of Quantum Mindfulness & Integrative Practices. The defense will include a presentation of research findings, followed by a question-and-answer session with a panel of experts. Successful defense will require a thorough understanding of the research topic and its implications for the field.
