## Getting Involved

The Graduate Student Organization Fair is held during the first week of each semester, providing an opportunity to meet representatives from all active groups. Throughout the year, you can explore current organizations and their activities through the Graduate Community Portal at community.tuos.edu.

To establish a new student organization, contact the Office of Graduate Student Life in Merrick Hall, Room 120, or email studentorgs@tuos.edu for guidance on the recognition process.

All graduate students are automatically members of the Graduate Ontological Society, which meets monthly in the Graduate Commons. Most specialized organizations have open membership and welcome new participants at any point in the academic year.

We encourage you to explore these communities early in your TUOS experience. These organizations not only enhance your academic journey but often lead to collaborative research, lasting friendships, and professional connections that extend well beyond your time at the university. Your active participation helps create the rich, supportive community that makes TUOS an exceptional environment for ontological inquiry.
