## Accessing Ethics & Compliance Services

The Research Ethics & Compliance Office is located in the Philosophy Building, Room 302. Staff are available for in-person consultations Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. For urgent matters, our ethics consultation line (555-123-4567) is monitored during extended hours.

Initial IRB consultations should be scheduled at least six weeks before planned research commencement. All ethics and compliance resources, including application forms, guidance documents, and training materials, are available through our online portal at ethics.tuos.edu.

We view ethics not as a hurdle to overcome but as an integral dimension of excellence in ontological science. Our office is committed to working collaboratively with you to ensure your research not only complies with regulatory requirements but embodies the profound ethical responsibility inherent in exploring the nature of consciousness and reality.
