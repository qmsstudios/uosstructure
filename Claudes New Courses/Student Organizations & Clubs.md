## Getting Involved

The Graduate Student Organization Fair is held during the first week of each semester, providing an opportunity to meet representatives from all active groups. Additionally, the online Organization Directory at studentlife.tuos.edu/organizations offers comprehensive information about each group, including meeting times, upcoming events, and contact information for current leaders.

To join most organizations, simply attend their meetings or events, which are advertised on the Graduate Events Calendar and through weekly email announcements. Leadership positions within organizations are typically filled through elections held at the beginning of each academic year.

If you don't find an organization that matches your interests, TUOS supports student initiative in creating new groups. Contact the Office of Graduate Student Life in Merrick Hall, Room 120, or email studentorgs@tuos.edu for guidance on the simple recognition process.

All graduate students are automatically members of the Graduate Ontological Society, which meets monthly in the Graduate Commons. Most specialized organizations have open membership and welcome new participants at any point in the academic year.

We encourage you to explore these communities early in your TUOS experience. These organizations not only enhance your academic journey but often lead to collaborative research, lasting friendships, and professional connections that extend well beyond your time at the university. Your active participation helps create the rich, supportive community that makes TUOS an exceptional environment for ontological inquiry.
