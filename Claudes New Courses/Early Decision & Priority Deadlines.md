# Early Decision & Priority Deadlines

At The University of Ontological Science (TUOS), we offer an Early Decision admissions option for students who have identified TUOS as their top choice institution. Early Decision allows applicants to receive an admissions decision earlier in the process and demonstrate their commitment to attending TUOS if admitted.

## Early Decision Admissions

The Early Decision (ED) admissions program is binding, meaning that if you are admitted under ED, you agree to withdraw your applications to all other colleges and universities and enroll at TUOS. To be considered for Early Decision, you must submit a completed application, including all required materials, by the ED deadline of November 1.

### Benefits of Applying Early Decision

Applying Early Decision to TUOS offers several advantages:

1. Receive an admissions decision by mid-December, allowing you to finalize your college plans early in the process.
2. Demonstrate your strong interest in TUOS and your commitment to attending if admitted.
3. Have peace of mind knowing that your college search is complete and you can focus on finishing your senior year strong.
4. Gain access to exclusive Early Decision scholarships and financial aid opportunities.

### Early Decision Admissions Timeline

- Application Deadline: November 1
