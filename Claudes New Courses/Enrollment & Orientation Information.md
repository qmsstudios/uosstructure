1. Accept your offer of admission: Log into your TUOS applicant portal and follow the prompts to formally accept your offer of admission.

2. Pay your enrollment deposit: Submit your non-refundable enrollment deposit through the online payment system accessible via your applicant portal. This deposit confirms your intention to enroll and is applied toward your first semester's tuition.

3. Set up your TUOS email account: Once you have accepted your offer and paid your deposit, you will receive instructions for setting up your official TUOS email account. This will be the primary means of communication between you and the university, so it is important to set it up promptly and check it regularly.

5. Submit your final transcripts: Ensure that your final high school or college transcripts are sent directly to the TUOS Office of Admissions. Your enrollment is contingent upon the successful completion of your current academic program.

## Course Registration

As an incoming student, you will work with your assigned academic advisor to select and register for your first semester's courses. The course registration process typically begins in mid-summer for the fall semester and in mid-December for the spring semester. Here's what you can expect:

1. Academic advising appointment: You will receive an email from your assigned academic advisor with instructions for scheduling a virtual or in-person advising appointment. During this meeting, your advisor will discuss your academic interests, degree requirements, and course options for your first semester.

2. Course selection: Based on your advising conversation, you will work with your advisor to select a set of courses that align with your academic goals and fulfill relevant degree requirements. Your advisor will guide you through the process of creating a balanced and manageable schedule.

3. Registration: After finalizing your course selections, your advisor will provide you with a registration PIN and instructions for enrolling in your chosen courses through the TUOS online student portal. Be sure to complete your registration by the specified deadline to ensure your desired course selections.

4. Textbooks and materials: Once you have registered for your courses, you can find the required textbooks and materials by visiting the TUOS bookstore website and entering your course information. You may choose to purchase or rent your books from the campus bookstore or from other reputable online retailers.

## Preparing for Your First Semester

As you look ahead to the start of your TUOS journey, there are several key steps you can take to ensure a successful transition:

1. Familiarize yourself with campus resources: Take time to explore the TUOS website and learn about the various academic, social, and wellness resources available to you, such as the University Library, the Writing Center, Student Health Services, and the Office of Student Life.

2. Connect with your classmates: Join the TUOS social media groups for incoming students and participate in virtual meet-ups or discussion forums to start building connections with your peers before you arrive on campus.

3. Plan your move: If you will be living on campus, make a list of the essential items you will need to bring and coordinate with your roommate(s) to avoid duplicating shared items. If you will be commuting, research transportation options and parking procedures.

4. Set goals and expectations: Take some time to reflect on your academic and personal goals for your first semester and beyond. Consider what steps you will need to take to achieve these goals and what resources you may need to draw upon for support.

We understand that the transition to university life can be both exciting and challenging, and we are committed to supporting you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns as you navigate the enrollment and orientation process, please don't hesitate to reach out to your admissions counselor, academic advisor, or the appropriate university office for guidance.

Once again, congratulations on your acceptance to The University of Ontological Science. We look forward to welcoming you to our community and supporting you as you embark on this transformative journey of intellectual and personal growth.
