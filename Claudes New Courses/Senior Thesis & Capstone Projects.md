## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I change my thesis topic after my proposal has been approved?**  
A: Minor refinements are common as research progresses. Significant changes require advisor approval and submission of a revised proposal. Consult with your advisor at the first sign that a substantial shift may be necessary.

**Q: What happens if I miss a thesis deadline?**  
A: Missing deadlines may delay your graduation. If extenuating circumstances arise, contact your advisor immediately and submit an [Extension Request Form](#) to your department chair. Extensions are not guaranteed and typically require documentation.

**Q: How much original research is expected?**  
A: The level of originality varies by discipline and project type. While undergraduate theses are not expected to produce groundbreaking discoveries, they should demonstrate independent analysis and contribute something novel to the conversation—whether a new application of existing ideas, a unique synthesis, or a fresh perspective on a longstanding question.

**Q: Can I write a thesis based on research I conducted in a faculty lab?**  
A: Yes, but your thesis must represent your own substantial intellectual contribution, not simply reporting on the lab's work. Discuss with both your advisor and the faculty lab director to ensure clear understanding of your independent contribution.

**Q: Is financial support available for thesis research?**  
A: Yes, TUOS offers competitive [Undergraduate Research Grants](#) of up to $1,000 for thesis-related expenses. Applications are due one semester before funding is needed. Some departments also offer specific research funding.

**Q: What happens if I don't complete my thesis by graduation?**  
A: If you've completed all other degree requirements, you have two options: (1) Graduate without thesis honors, or (2) Delay graduation by registering for Thesis Continuation status for up to one additional semester.
