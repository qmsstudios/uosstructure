# Leave of Absence & Withdrawals

The University of Ontological Science recognizes that students may need to interrupt their academic studies due to personal, medical, or professional circumstances. Our leave of absence and withdrawal policies ensure students can address their needs while maintaining a clear path to continue their academic pursuits in consciousness studies, cognitive science, and related fields.

## Leave of Absence

A leave of absence allows students to temporarily suspend their studies while maintaining their relationship with the university. Students may request a leave of absence for personal development, medical treatment, professional opportunities, or other significant life events that require a pause in academic progression.

### Requesting a Leave

Students seeking a leave must submit a formal request through their academic advisor. This request should detail the reason for the leave, proposed duration, and plans for eventual return to studies. Supporting documentation may be required depending on the nature of the leave request. Early submission allows time for thorough review and appropriate academic planning.

### Duration and Extensions

Initial leaves typically extend for one or two semesters. Students requiring additional time may request extensions, though total leave time cannot exceed two years. Extended leaves require updated documentation and renewed approval from academic advisors and program directors.

### Academic Impact

Course enrollment and research activities suspend during approved leaves. Students maintain their academic standing and program placement throughout the approved leave period. However, they should work with advisors to understand how the leave might affect sequential courses or research progression.

### Returning from Leave

Students must notify the university of their intent to return at least six weeks before the semester begins. This allows time to review academic standing, update program requirements, and ensure appropriate course registration. Returning students meet with academic advisors to revise their academic plans and ensure smooth reintegration into their programs.

## University Withdrawal

A university withdrawal represents a complete separation from academic studies at TUOS. Students may withdraw for various reasons, including transfer to another institution, career changes, or personal circumstances that prevent continued enrollment.

### Withdrawal Process

Students considering withdrawal should first consult with their academic advisor to discuss their decision and explore potential alternatives. The formal withdrawal process requires submission of official documentation and completion of an exit interview. This process ensures proper closure of academic records and university accounts.

### Documentation Requirements

Withdrawing students must submit a formal withdrawal request detailing their reasons for leaving and confirming their understanding of the withdrawal's implications. They must also complete necessary paperwork to address ongoing academic and administrative commitments.

### Academic Record Impact

Withdrawal timing affects how courses appear on academic transcripts. Withdrawals processed before the semester's withdrawal deadline result in W grades for current courses. Later withdrawals may result in earned grades based on completed coursework.

### Refund Eligibility

Tuition refund eligibility depends on the withdrawal date relative to the academic calendar. Early withdrawals may qualify for partial refunds according to the university's refund schedule. Students should review the current refund policy to understand their eligibility.

## Maintaining Academic Records

Both leaves of absence and withdrawals become part of the student's permanent academic record. The university maintains these records in accordance with privacy regulations while ensuring appropriate documentation for future academic or professional needs.

## Returning After Withdrawal

Students who withdraw may apply for readmission if they wish to resume their studies. Readmission requires a new application and current documentation. The university evaluates readmission requests based on academic standing at withdrawal, time elapsed, and current program requirements.

## Research Considerations

Students engaged in ongoing research projects must work with faculty advisors to appropriately conclude or suspend their research activities. This ensures proper documentation and preservation of research materials during their absence.
