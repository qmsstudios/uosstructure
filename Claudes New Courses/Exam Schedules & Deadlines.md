## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What should I do if I'm ill on the day of a final exam?**

A: Final exams are typically held in the regular classroom unless otherwise specified by your instructor. Any location changes will be announced in class and posted on Canvas at least one week before exams.

**Q: What items am I allowed to bring to my exam?**  
A: Permitted materials vary by course and instructor. Your syllabus should outline what is allowed, but instructors will also provide specific guidance before the exam. If uncertain, ask your instructor directly.
