## Accessing AI & Data Science Resources

The AI & Data Science for Ontological Research center is located in the Turing Wing of the Science Complex. Graduate students can access computational resources through our online portal at compute.tuos.edu after completing the required orientation session, offered biweekly throughout the semester.

For individualized consultations on integrating computational methods into your research, schedule an appointment with our methodological specialists through the Graduate Research Portal. We recommend meeting with a computational research consultant early in your research design process to explore how these powerful tools might enhance your investigation.

At TUOS, we view computational approaches not as replacements for philosophical inquiry but as powerful complementary tools that extend our capabilities. By thoughtfully integrating AI and data science methodologies with rigorous philosophical frameworks, you can develop research approaches that honor both the quantitative power of computation and the qualitative depth of ontological questioning.
