# Aid Adjustments Due to Enrollment Changes

## How Enrollment Changes Affect Your Financial Aid

At The University of Ontological Science (TUOS), your financial aid package is initially based on your anticipated enrollment status. When your actual enrollment differs from what was planned, your financial aid will be adjusted accordingly. Understanding how these adjustments work is crucial for managing your educational finances.

## Enrollment Status Categories

Financial aid is awarded based on the following enrollment statuses:

| Status | Undergraduate | Graduate/Doctoral |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Full-time | 12+ credit hours | 9+ credit hours |
| Three-quarter time | 9-11 credit hours | 7-8 credit hours |
| Half-time | 6-8 credit hours | 5-6 credit hours |
| Less than half-time | 1-5 credit hours | 1-4 credit hours |

## When Adjustments Occur

Your financial aid will be reviewed and potentially adjusted at these key times:

- **Census Date**: The official enrollment verification date (10th class day of each term)
- **After Add/Drop Period**: When your schedule is finalized
- **Upon Withdrawal**: If you withdraw from some or all courses
- **When Changing Degree Programs**: If program changes affect enrollment

## Types of Aid Affected by Enrollment Changes

Different types of aid respond differently to enrollment changes:

### Federal Grants (Pell, FSEOG)
- Automatically prorated based on enrollment status
- Recalculated at census date
- May be reduced or increased when enrollment changes

### State Grants
- Most require at least half-time enrollment
- Some require full-time enrollment
- May be completely lost if dropping below required threshold

### Federal Direct Loans
- Require at least half-time enrollment
- Cannot be disbursed if you drop below half-time
- May trigger loan repayment if you drop below half-time for an extended period

### Institutional Scholarships
- Many TUOS scholarships require full-time enrollment
- Check your specific scholarship terms for requirements
- May be reduced proportionally or completely lost depending on terms

### Work-Study
- Generally requires at least half-time enrollment
- Hours and earnings may be limited if not full-time

## Impact of Specific Enrollment Changes

### Adding Courses
- May increase aid eligibility if moving to a higher enrollment status
- Added courses must be required for your degree program
- Additional aid will be disbursed after census date if applicable

### Dropping Courses
- May decrease aid if dropping to a lower enrollment status
- If done before census date, aid will be adjusted automatically
- If done after census date, may create a financial aid debt

### Complete Withdrawal
- Triggers Return of Title IV funds calculation
- May create significant financial obligations
- Affects future aid eligibility and academic progress
- May affect loan grace periods and repayment schedules

### Non-Attendance/No-Shows
- Courses where you never attend are excluded from enrollment calculation
- May significantly reduce aid if reported as non-attending

## Course Program of Study Requirements

Financial aid only covers courses that count toward your degree requirements. Taking courses outside your program of study can affect your enrollment status for financial aid purposes, even if you remain enrolled in the same number of total credits.

## Timeline for Adjustments

- **Pre-Census Adjustments**: Processed within 5-7 business days
- **Post-Census Adjustments**: May take 7-10 business days
- **Return of Title IV Calculations**: Completed within 30 days of withdrawal

## Notification of Adjustments

When your financial aid is adjusted due to enrollment changes:

1. You will receive an email notification to your TUOS email account
2. Your updated award letter will be available in the Student Portal
3. Any resulting balance due will appear on your student account
4. If a refund is due, it will be processed according to your refund preferences

## Financial Implications

Enrollment changes can have significant financial consequences:

- **Reduced Aid**: May create an unexpected balance due on your account
- **Repayment Obligations**: May require immediate repayment of disbursed funds
- **Satisfactory Academic Progress**: Withdrawals count as attempted but not completed credits

## Planning for Enrollment Changes

If you anticipate changing your enrollment:

1. **Consult with a Financial Aid Counselor**: Discuss the impact before making changes
2. **Meet with Academic Advisor**: Ensure any schedule changes keep you on track for graduation
3. **Review Your Award Terms**: Understand specific requirements for each aid type
4. **Check Important Dates**: Be aware of census dates and deadlines

## Special Circumstances

Some situations may qualify for special consideration:

- **Medical Withdrawals**: May qualify for exceptions with proper documentation
- **Military Deployment**: Special provisions apply
- **COVID-19 Related Issues**: Temporary flexibility may be available
