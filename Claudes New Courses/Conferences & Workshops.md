## Engaging with Conferences & Workshops

The annual Calendar of Events is published each August, listing all planned TUOS conferences and workshops for the academic year. Registration for university-hosted events typically opens 2-3 months before each event, with early registration discounts available.

For information about current conference opportunities, visit the Academic Events Portal at events.tuos.edu or contact the Office of Academic Conferences in Berkeley Hall, Room 304.

We strongly encourage graduate students to participate in at least one significant conference annually, either at TUOS or externally. To support this participation, application deadlines for travel funding occur three times yearly (September 15, January 15, and May 15), with details available through the Graduate Research Office.

At TUOS, we view conferences and workshops not merely as venues for presentation but as vital communities of practice where the collaborative work of advancing ontological understanding unfolds. Through active engagement with these opportunities, you join an ongoing conversation that extends far beyond our campus—contributing your unique voice to our collective exploration of the most fundamental questions about consciousness, reality, and human experience.
