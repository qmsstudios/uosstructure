## Accessing OSF Support at TUOS

The Open Science Support Team is based in the Graduate Research Center (Heidegger Building, Room 205) and offers consultations Monday through Friday, 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. To schedule a consultation, email openscience@tuos.edu or book directly through the Graduate Portal.

Monthly OSF workshops rotate through introductory and advanced topics, with the schedule posted on the Graduate Research Center website. Department-specific implementations are available upon request for research groups or courses.

For technical assistance with OSF, our dedicated helpdesk is available at osf-help@tuos.edu, with typical response times under 24 hours.

We recommend that all graduate students create an OSF account and complete the "OSF Essentials" online tutorial during their first semester. Consider attending an in-person workshop before beginning your first major research project to ensure you establish effective open science practices from the start.

At TUOS, we believe that open, transparent research practices not only enhance the credibility and impact of your work but also align with our deeper philosophical commitments to shared inquiry into the nature of consciousness, reality, and human experience. By embracing these practices through platforms like OSF, you contribute to a more collaborative, rigorous approach to ontological science that benefits both the scholarly community and society at large.
