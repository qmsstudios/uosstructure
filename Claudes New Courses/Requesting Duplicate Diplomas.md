# Requesting Duplicate Diplomas

## The University of Ontological Science

### Overview

Your TUOS diploma represents years of dedication and intellectual achievement. We understand that circumstances may arise necessitating a replacement diploma, whether due to loss, damage, or a legal name change. The Office of the Registrar is committed to helping you obtain a duplicate diploma that maintains the prestigious quality and authenticity of your original document.

In the event that you need a duplicate copy of your diploma, TUOS makes it easy to request one. Whether you've lost your original diploma, it has been damaged, or you simply need an additional copy, we've streamlined the process to help you obtain an official replacement with minimal hassle.
