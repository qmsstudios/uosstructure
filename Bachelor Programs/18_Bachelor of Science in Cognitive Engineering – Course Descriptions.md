### CSC 101. Foundations of Cognitive Science

An introductory course on cognitive science, covering its interdisciplinary roots in philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and computer science. Students will explore core questions about how the mind works and how mental processes are represented.

### CSC 102. Cognitive Neuroscience & Brain Dynamics

A detailed exploration of the neural basis of cognition, focusing on brain dynamics underlying attention, perception, memory, and decision-making. Students will examine brain imaging techniques and case studies.

### CSC 201. Cognitive Models & Mental Representations

This course introduces computational and symbolic models of cognitive processes. Students will learn how mental representations are structured and manipulated to support reasoning, problem-solving, and memory.

### CSC 202. Attention, Perception & Memory Systems

An examination of attention, sensory perception, and memory systems from a cognitive perspective. Topics include visual perception, working memory, and attentional control.

### CSC 203. Computational Cognitive Science

A course focused on computational approaches to modeling cognition. Students will explore neural networks, machine learning models, and computational simulations of cognitive processes.

### CSC 301. Embodied Cognition & Action

This course investigates how cognitive processes are influenced by bodily interactions with the environment. Topics include sensorimotor integration, affordances, and embodied learning.

### CSC 302. Language, Thought & Concept Formation

A study of how language shapes thought and concept formation. Students will examine linguistic relativity, conceptual metaphor theory, and the role of language in cognitive development.

### CSC 303. Cognitive Development & Learning Processes

An exploration of how cognitive abilities develop across the lifespan. Students will study cognitive development theories and the role of experience and environment in learning.

### CSC 401. Cognitive Interfaces & Human-Computer Interaction

A practical course on designing cognitive-friendly interfaces for human-computer interaction. Topics include usability, cognitive load, and adaptive interface design.

### CSC 402. Cognitive Science in Artificial Intelligence

This course explores how cognitive science principles are applied in AI development. Topics include natural language processing, AI reasoning systems, and cognitive architectures.

### CSC 403. Advanced Topics in Cognitive Science

A seminar-style course on cutting-edge research and emerging topics in cognitive science. Students will engage in discussions, projects, and independent research.

### CSC 499. Capstone in Cognitive Science

A comprehensive research project where students synthesize their learning in cognitive science to solve a real-world problem or conduct a theoretical investigation. The capstone involves both a written report and a presentation.
