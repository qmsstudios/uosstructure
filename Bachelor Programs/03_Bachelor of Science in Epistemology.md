The Bachelor of Science in Epistemology provides an in-depth exploration of the nature, scope, and structure of knowledge. This program is designed for students interested in understanding the processes of justification, belief systems, cognitive reliability, and formal epistemology, blending traditional theories with modern approaches in cognitive science and artificial intelligence.

## **About the Program**

The B.Sc. in Epistemology offers a rigorous academic foundation in the study of knowledge and belief, as well as the criteria for what constitutes justified belief. Students will delve into classical and contemporary epistemic theories, examining how these frameworks can be applied to modern challenges in AI-driven knowledge modeling, decision theory, and cognitive science.

This program encourages a multidisciplinary approach, integrating philosophical inquiry with empirical research methods from psychology and cognitive science. Through courses focusing on perception, inference, and knowledge validation, students will learn to critically assess the mechanisms through which knowledge is acquired and validated across various disciplines.

### **Key Areas of Study**

•	Foundations of Epistemic Theory

•	Cognitive Reliability and Belief Systems

•	AI-Driven Knowledge Modeling and Decision Theory

•	Philosophy of Perception and Inference

•	Research Methodologies in Cognitive Modeling

### **Career Pathways**

Graduates of the B.Sc. in Epistemology are well-prepared for careers in philosophy, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and research methodologies. The program also lays a strong foundation for advanced studies in epistemology, philosophy of mind, and other related fields, equipping students with critical thinking and analytical skills necessary for both academic and professional success.
