Students will gain foundational knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary for advanced study in consciousness.

### CON 102. Phenomenology of Mind & Self

This course examines the subjective experience of mind and self from a phenomenological perspective. Students will explore first-person approaches to consciousness, focusing on lived experience and intentionality. The course includes readings from key phenomenological texts and practical exercises in self-reflection.

### CON 201. Neural Correlates of Consciousness

A neuroscience-focused course investigating the neural basis of conscious experience. Topics include the relationship between neural activity and states of awareness, perception, and self-reference. Students will engage with current research and methodologies used to study the brain's role in consciousness.

### CON 202. States of Consciousness & Altered States

A study of various states of consciousness, including waking, dreaming, meditative states, and altered states induced by psychedelics and other means. Students will explore the neural and psychological underpinnings of these states. The course includes experiential learning opportunities and discussions on the implications of altered states.

### CON 203. Meditation & Contemplative Neuroscience

This course focuses on the neuroscience of meditation and contemplative practices. Students will study how meditation influences cognitive functions, emotional regulation, and consciousness. The curriculum includes scientific literature on meditation research and practical sessions on different meditation techniques.

### CON 301. Consciousness in Non-Human Species

An examination of consciousness in animals and non-human systems. Topics include animal cognition, self-awareness, and the ethical implications of consciousness in non-human life forms. Students will review comparative studies and engage in ethical debates regarding animal consciousness.

### CON 302. Conscious Experience & Subjective Reality

A deep dive into subjective reality and how individual experiences shape perception and cognition. Students will analyze the relationship between subjective awareness and external reality. The course includes case studies and theoretical models that explain the construction of subjective reality.

### CON 303. Quantum Consciousness & Mind Theories

A specialized course exploring quantum theories of consciousness and how they intersect with traditional cognitive science. Topics include quantum mind hypotheses and non-local consciousness. Students will critically evaluate the scientific and philosophical arguments for and against quantum consciousness theories.

### CON 401. Consciousness & Cognitive Integration

This course investigates how consciousness integrates sensory, cognitive, and emotional processes into a cohesive experience. Students will explore theories of binding and unified awareness. The course includes practical exercises in cognitive integration and analysis of case studies.

### CON 402. Spirituality, Psychology, & Consciousness

An interdisciplinary course exploring the intersection of spirituality, psychology, and consciousness studies. Students will analyze transformative experiences, peak states, and their psychological significance. The curriculum includes readings from spiritual traditions and contemporary psychological research.

### CON 403. Advanced Topics in Consciousness Studies

A seminar-style course on current research and emerging topics in consciousness studies. Students will engage in discussions, case studies, and independent research. The course is designed to foster critical thinking and innovation in the field of consciousness studies.

### CON 499. Capstone in Consciousness Research

A research-intensive project where students synthesize their knowledge of consciousness studies in a thesis or applied project. The capstone integrates theoretical perspectives with practical applications. Students will work closely with faculty mentors to develop and complete their research projects.
