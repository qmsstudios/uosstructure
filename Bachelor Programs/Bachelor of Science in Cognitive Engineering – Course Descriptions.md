### CSC 101. Foundations of Cognitive Science

An introductory course on cognitive science, covering its interdisciplinary roots in philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and computer science. Students will explore core questions about how the mind works and how mental processes are represented. The course includes lectures, discussions, and hands-on activities to provide a comprehensive overview of cognitive science.

### CSC 102. Cognitive Neuroscience & Brain Dynamics

A detailed exploration of the neural basis of cognition, focusing on brain dynamics underlying attention, perception, memory, and decision-making. Students will examine brain imaging techniques such as fMRI and EEG, and analyze case studies to understand how different brain regions contribute to cognitive functions. The course also includes lab sessions for practical experience with neuroimaging tools.

### CSC 201. Cognitive Models & Mental Representations

This course introduces computational and symbolic models of cognitive processes. Students will learn how mental representations are structured and manipulated to support reasoning, problem-solving, and memory. The course covers various modeling techniques, including connectionist models, symbolic AI, and hybrid approaches, with practical assignments to build and test cognitive models.

### CSC 202. Attention, Perception & Memory Systems

An examination of attention, sensory perception, and memory systems from a cognitive perspective. Topics include visual perception, working memory, and attentional control. The course combines theoretical lectures with experimental labs where students can conduct their own research on cognitive processes and analyze data using statistical software.

### CSC 203. Computational Cognitive Science

A course focused on computational approaches to modeling cognition. Students will explore neural networks, machine learning models, and computational simulations of cognitive processes. The course includes programming assignments in languages such as Python and MATLAB, and projects where students develop their own cognitive models to solve specific problems.

### CSC 301. Embodied Cognition & Action

This course investigates how cognitive processes are influenced by bodily interactions with the environment. Topics include sensorimotor integration, affordances, and embodied learning. Students will engage in experiments and projects that demonstrate the principles of embodied cognition, and analyze how physical actions and environmental contexts shape cognitive functions.

### CSC 302. Language, Thought & Concept Formation

A study of how language shapes thought and concept formation. Students will examine linguistic relativity, conceptual metaphor theory, and the role of language in cognitive development. The course includes readings from seminal texts, discussions on contemporary research, and projects that explore the relationship between language and cognition in different cultural contexts.

### CSC 303. Cognitive Development & Learning Processes

An exploration of how cognitive abilities develop across the lifespan. Students will study cognitive development theories and the role of experience and environment in learning. The course covers developmental milestones, the impact of education and social interactions on cognitive growth, and includes observational studies and case analyses.

### CSC 401. Cognitive Interfaces & Human-Computer Interaction

A practical course on designing cognitive-friendly interfaces for human-computer interaction. Topics include usability, cognitive load, and adaptive interface design. Students will work on projects to create and test user interfaces, applying principles of cognitive psychology to enhance user experience and accessibility.

### CSC 402. Cognitive Science in Artificial Intelligence

This course explores how cognitive science principles are applied in AI development. Topics include natural language processing, AI reasoning systems, and cognitive architectures. Students will study existing AI systems, participate in coding projects to implement cognitive algorithms, and discuss ethical considerations in AI development.

### CSC 403. Advanced Topics in Cognitive Science

A seminar-style course on cutting-edge research and emerging topics in cognitive science. Students will engage in discussions, projects, and independent research on topics such as cognitive robotics, neuroethics, and the impact of technology on cognition. The course encourages critical thinking and collaboration on innovative research projects.

### CSC 499. Capstone in Cognitive Science

A comprehensive research project where students synthesize their learning in cognitive science to solve a real-world problem or conduct a theoretical investigation. The capstone involves both a written report and a presentation. Students will work under the guidance of a faculty advisor, conduct literature reviews, design experiments or simulations, and present their findings to peers and faculty.
