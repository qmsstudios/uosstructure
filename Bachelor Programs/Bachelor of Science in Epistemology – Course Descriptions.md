**EPI 101. Introduction to Epistemology**

An introductory course on the study of knowledge, focusing on foundational questions such as what knowledge is, how it is acquired, and what distinguishes justified belief from opinion. Students will explore classical and contemporary theories of knowledge, examining key figures and texts in the field. The course will also cover the historical development of epistemology and its relevance to other areas of philosophy and science.

### **EPI 102. Theory of Knowledge**

A detailed exploration of key concepts in the theory of knowledge, including skepticism, sources of knowledge (perception, reason, memory), and the nature of justification. This course provides a comprehensive framework for understanding epistemic inquiry, addressing questions about the limits of human knowledge and the criteria for truth. Students will engage with various philosophical arguments and develop critical thinking skills to analyze complex epistemological issues.

### **EPI 201. Justification & Belief Systems**

This course examines the structure and dynamics of belief systems, focusing on what constitutes justification for holding a belief. Topics include coherence, foundationalism, and reliabilism. Students will investigate different theories of justification and their implications for knowledge claims. The course will also explore the role of evidence, rationality, and context in shaping belief systems, encouraging students to critically assess their own beliefs.

### **EPI 202. Cognitive Epistemology**

An interdisciplinary approach to epistemology that draws on cognitive science to understand how humans acquire and process knowledge. Students will study topics such as mental models, heuristics, and cognitive biases, examining how these cognitive processes influence our understanding of the world. The course will also explore the implications of cognitive science for traditional epistemological questions and the potential for integrating insights from psychology and neuroscience.

### **EPI 203. Foundations of Perception & Reality**

A philosophical and scientific examination of perception and its role in shaping our understanding of reality. Students will explore the relationship between sensory experiences and the external world, considering theories of perception from both philosophical and empirical perspectives. The course will address questions about the reliability of sensory information, the nature of perceptual illusions, and the connection between perception and knowledge.

### **EPI 301. Epistemic Logic & Reasoning**

A specialized course on formal reasoning and epistemic logic, focusing on how logical systems represent knowledge, belief, and informational states. Applications in artificial intelligence and decision theory are highlighted. Students will learn about modal logic, possible worlds semantics, and the formal properties of knowledge and belief. The course will also cover practical applications of epistemic logic in areas such as computer science, economics, and game theory.

### **EPI 302. Social Epistemology**

A study of the social dimensions of knowledge, including collective belief, epistemic authority, and the role of institutions in shaping public knowledge. Case studies on misinformation and consensus-building are emphasized. Students will examine how social factors influence the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge, exploring topics such as testimony, trust, and the impact of social networks. The course will also address contemporary issues related to the spread of information and the challenges of achieving epistemic justice.

### **EPI 303. Knowledge Representation & Information Flow**

This course covers methods for representing knowledge in structured systems. Students will explore ontologies, knowledge graphs, and the flow of information in networks and databases. The course will provide an overview of different approaches to knowledge representation, including symbolic and connectionist models. Students will also learn about the practical challenges of designing and implementing knowledge-based systems, with a focus on applications in artificial intelligence and data science.

### **EPI 401. Computational Epistemology**

An advanced course that bridges epistemology and computational methods. Students will analyze how computational models represent knowledge acquisition, belief structures, and reasoning processes. The course will cover topics such as machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, and algorithmic epistemology. Students will engage with current research in the field and develop skills in using computational tools to address epistemological questions.

### **EPI 402. Epistemology in Artificial Intelligence**

A specialized course on the role of epistemology in AI, focusing on knowledge representation, reasoning, and machine learning. Students will study how AI systems process and evaluate knowledge, considering the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence. The course will address issues such as the transparency and explainability of AI systems, the ethical dimensions of AI decision-making, and the potential for AI to enhance or undermine human knowledge.

### **EPI 403. Advanced Topics in Epistemology**

A seminar-style course exploring emerging topics in epistemology, such as virtual epistemology, epistemic injustice, and the impact of technology on human knowledge. Students will engage in discussions and independent research, critically examining new developments in the field. The course will provide an opportunity for students to explore their own interests in epistemology and contribute to ongoing debates about the nature and limits of knowledge.

### **EPI 499. Capstone in Epistemic Research**

A research-intensive project where students synthesize their knowledge of epistemology in a comprehensive thesis or applied project. The capstone focuses on integrating theory with practical applications, allowing students to demonstrate their understanding of key epistemological concepts and their ability to conduct independent research. Students will work closely with faculty advisors to develop their projects, which may involve original research, literature reviews, or applied work in areas such as education, technology, or public policy.
