The Bachelor of Science in Cognitive Neuroscience offers a comprehensive exploration of the complex relationship between the brain and cognition. This interdisciplinary program bridges the fields of neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, and computational modeling, equipping students with the knowledge and skills to investigate the neural mechanisms that drive human thought, emotion, behavior, and consciousness.

Students in the program will engage in rigorous study and hands-on research to uncover how brain processes relate to cognitive functions such as memory, perception, decision-making, and emotional regulation. By combining theoretical frameworks with practical application, students gain a deep understanding of how neural circuits shape behavior and cognition at both the micro (cellular) and macro (systems) levels.

**About the Program**

The B.Sc. in Cognitive Neuroscience is designed for students passionate about understanding the biological foundations of mental processes and behavior. This program offers an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the brain, integrating neurobiology, computational methods, and experimental psychology. Through coursework, lab experiences, and independent research projects, students will explore how neural activity correlates with cognitive processes, such as attention, language, problem-solving, and consciousness.

The program emphasizes both fundamental neuroscience concepts and cutting-edge developments in brain research. Key topics include neural imaging techniques, neuroplasticity, brain-computer interfaces, and neural network modeling. With a focus on computational and experimental approaches, students will have opportunities to conduct research in areas such as consciousness studies, neural regeneration, and neuroinformatics.

Graduates will be well-prepared for careers in neuroscience research, cognitive psychology, neurotechnology, and related fields. The program also serves as a strong foundation for advanced study in neuroscience, cognitive science, neuropsychology, and medical fields.

**Key Areas of Study**

- **Neural Mechanisms of Cognition** – Understanding how neural circuits and brain regions support various cognitive processes, including memory, attention, and executive functions.
- **Brain Imaging and Neural Network Modeling** – Gaining proficiency in brain imaging techniques (e.g., fMRI, EEG) and computational modeling of neural networks to analyze cognitive processes.
- **Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience** – Examining how cognitive and emotional processes interact at the neural level and how they influence behavior and mental health.
- **Neuroplasticity and Learning** – Exploring the brain’s capacity to adapt and reorganize itself through experience and learning, with implications for brain recovery and development.
- **Brain-Computer Interfaces and Neurotechnology** – Investigating emerging technologies that connect the brain with external devices to enhance cognitive function, control machines, and expand human capabilities.
