### QCO 101. Introduction to Quantum Cognition

An overview of quantum cognition, exploring how concepts from quantum theory apply to human decision-making and cognitive processes. Students will learn about the foundations of probabilistic cognition and mental states. Key topics include the basics of quantum theory, cognitive science principles, and the intersection of these fields.

### QCO 102. Cognitive Superposition & Interference

This course examines how cognitive states can exist in superposed forms until focus collapses them into specific outcomes. Topics include cognitive interference, uncertainty, and parallel thought processes. Students will engage in thought experiments and practical exercises to understand these phenomena.

### QCO 201. Quantum Decision Theory

A specialized course on decision-making through the lens of quantum probability. Students will analyze how quantum models provide alternative explanations for choices under uncertainty. The course includes case studies, mathematical modeling, and applications in real-world decision-making scenarios.

### QCO 202. Cognitive Measurement & Collapse

A study of how attention and conscious focus act as a measurement process that collapses cognitive superposition into specific outcomes. Students will explore implications for perception, memory, and decision-making. The course covers experimental methods and theoretical frameworks for understanding cognitive collapse.

### QCO 203. Quantum Mind Theory

An advanced course on quantum mind theory, focusing on how molecular energy subdivisions form distinct cognitive dimensions. Students will explore connections between neuroscience and quantum frameworks. Topics include the quantum brain hypothesis, neural correlates of consciousness, and interdisciplinary research methods.

### QCO 301. Non-Local Cognition & Perception

A theoretical course on non-local cognition, which explores consciousness as a fundamental phenomenon beyond time and space. Topics include distant perception, mental connectivity, and intuition. Students will review historical and contemporary research, and participate in discussions on the implications of non-locality for cognitive science.

### QCO 302. Probabilistic Reasoning & Uncertainty

This course focuses on reasoning under uncertainty, drawing on quantum probability theory. Students will compare classical and quantum models of belief updating and prediction. The curriculum includes statistical analysis, probability theory, and cognitive psychology experiments.

### QCO 303. Quantum Wave Functions in Cognitive States

An exploration of how cognitive states can be represented as wave functions. Students will learn about wave interference, amplitude, and the role of probabilities in cognitive processes. The course includes mathematical derivations, simulations, and practical applications in cognitive modeling.

### QCO 401. Cognitive Entanglement & Mental States

A deep dive into cognitive entanglement, studying how mental states are intrinsically linked across psychodynamic dimensions. Case studies will examine shared mental phenomena and emotional synchronization. Students will engage in collaborative projects and experimental research to explore entanglement in cognitive processes.

### QCO 402. Sequential Influence in Cognitive Processing

A course on how the sequence of information presentation influences cognitive outcomes. Topics include order effects, framing, and temporal dynamics in decision-making. Students will conduct experiments, analyze data, and apply findings to understand the impact of sequence on cognition.

### QCO 403. Advanced Topics in Quantum Cognition

A seminar exploring cutting-edge research and emerging topics in quantum cognition. Students will engage with experimental data, recent publications, and debates in the field. The course includes guest lectures, research presentations, and critical discussions on future directions in quantum cognition.

### QCO 499. Capstone in Quantum Cognition Research

A culminating research project where students synthesize their knowledge of quantum cognition in a comprehensive thesis or applied project. The capstone involves both written and presentation components. Students will work under faculty supervision to design, execute, and present their research, demonstrating mastery of the field.
