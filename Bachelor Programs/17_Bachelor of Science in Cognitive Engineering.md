The Bachelor of Science in Cognitive Engineering is crafted for students interested in the scientific and experimental study of thought processes, perception, and decision-making mechanisms. This program provides a robust, data-driven approach to understanding cognition, incorporating psychometric methodologies, cognitive modeling, and neurobehavioral research.

**About the Program**

The B.S. in Cognitive Engineering integrates advanced scientific principles with practical applications to examine and enhance cognitive functions. Students will gain in-depth knowledge of how cognitive processes are structured and can be engineered or modified. This program emphasizes the development of quantitative and analytical skills necessary for creating and implementing cognitive models that simulate human thinking and decision-making processes.

Through a curriculum that includes quantum cognition, psychodynamic processing units (PPUs), cognitive wave interference, and applied cognitive reinforcement strategies, students will learn to assess and influence cognitive behaviors effectively. These studies prepare them for critical roles in behavioral research, AI cognitive structuring, and psychometric modeling, enabling them to contribute to advancements in cognitive technologies and therapies.
