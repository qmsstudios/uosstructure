### **ONT 101. Introduction to Ontology**

A foundational course exploring the concept of being and existence, focusing on classical and contemporary ontological frameworks. Students will examine key questions about the nature of reality, objects, properties, and their relationships.

### **ONT 102. Philosophical Ontology**

This course delves into the philosophical roots of ontology, analyzing how major thinkers have approached the study of existence and categories of being. Special emphasis is placed on metaphysical debates about universals, identity, and essence.

### **ONT 201. Ontological Foundations of Logic**

An introduction to the relationship between ontology and logic, exploring how logical structures reflect reality. Topics include propositional logic, predicate logic, and the role of logical systems in ontological modeling.

### **ONT 202. Computational Ontology & Knowledge Structures**

This course focuses on how computational systems represent and manage ontological knowledge. Students will learn the basics of ontology development for artificial intelligence and knowledge-based systems.

### **ONT 203. Ontology in Information Systems**

A practical course on applying ontological principles to information systems and databases. Topics include semantic data integration, ontology-based search, and the use of ontologies in digital environments.

### **ONT 301. Formal Ontology & Conceptual Analysis**

This course explores the formal representation of ontological categories and concepts using structured models and diagrams. Students will engage in conceptual analysis to identify and classify core elements of reality within different formal systems.

### **ONT 302. Ontology & Epistemology**

An integrative course examining the intersection of ontology and epistemology. Students will study how ontological assumptions influence theories of knowledge, focusing on belief structures, justification, and reality.

### **ONT 303. Ontology for Social Systems**

A specialized course on the application of ontological frameworks to social structures and networks. Topics include social ontology, collective intentionality, and the representation of roles, institutions, and groups.

**ONT 401. Ontology & AI Integration**

This course investigates how ontologies are used in artificial intelligence to enhance reasoning, knowledge representation, and data integration. Practical case studies on AI systems and knowledge graphs are emphasized.

**ONT 402. Ontological Research Methods**

A methodological course focused on conducting research in ontology, including both theoretical and applied approaches. Students will develop skills in literature review, hypothesis formation, and ontology-based analysis.

**ONT 403. Ontology in Decision Support Systems**

An applied course on using ontology for decision-making in complex environments. Students will study ontology-driven decision support tools in fields such as healthcare, governance, and finance.

**ONT 499. Capstone in Ontological Research**

A culminating research project where students synthesize their knowledge to address a specific ontological question or develop an applied ontology framework. The capstone includes both written and presentation components.
