### **ONT 101. Introduction to Ontology**

A foundational course exploring the concept of being and existence, focusing on classical and contemporary ontological frameworks. Students will examine key questions about the nature of reality, objects, properties, and their relationships. The course will cover historical perspectives from ancient to modern times, providing a comprehensive overview of how ontological questions have evolved. Students will engage in discussions, readings, and critical analyses to develop a deep understanding of ontological principles.

### **ONT 102. Philosophical Ontology**

This course delves into the philosophical roots of ontology, analyzing how major thinkers have approached the study of existence and categories of being. Special emphasis is placed on metaphysical debates about universals, identity, and essence. Students will explore the contributions of philosophers such as Aristotle, Kant, and Heidegger, and examine how their ideas have shaped contemporary ontological thought. The course will also cover the implications of these debates for other areas of philosophy and science, including ethics, epistemology, and the philosophy of mind. Through essays, presentations, and discussions, students will critically engage with complex philosophical texts and ideas.

### **ONT 201. Ontological Foundations of Logic**

An introduction to the relationship between ontology and logic, exploring how logical structures reflect reality. Topics include propositional logic, predicate logic, and the role of logical systems in ontological modeling. Students will learn how to construct and analyze logical arguments, understand the ontological commitments of different logical systems, and explore the philosophical implications of logical theories. The course includes problem sets, logical exercises, and theoretical discussions to build a solid foundation in both logic and ontology.

### **ONT 202. Computational Ontology & Knowledge Structures**

This course focuses on how computational systems represent and manage ontological knowledge. Students will learn the basics of ontology development for artificial intelligence and knowledge-based systems. Topics include ontology languages (such as OWL), ontology engineering methodologies, and the use of ontologies in semantic web technologies. Practical assignments will involve creating and manipulating ontologies using software tools, as well as case studies on the application of ontologies in various domains such as healthcare, e-commerce, and information retrieval.

### **ONT 203. Ontology in Information Systems**

A practical course on applying ontological principles to information systems and databases. Topics include semantic data integration, ontology-based search, and the use of ontologies in digital environments. Students will explore how ontologies can improve data interoperability, enhance search capabilities, and support complex queries. The course includes hands-on projects where students will design and implement ontological models for real-world information systems, as well as discussions on the challenges and best practices in ontology-driven information management.

### **ONT 301. Formal Ontology & Conceptual Analysis**

This course explores the formal representation of ontological categories and concepts using structured models and diagrams. Students will engage in conceptual analysis to identify and classify core elements of reality within different formal systems. Topics include formal ontology languages, the role of axioms and definitions, and the use of formal methods in ontology verification and validation. Through projects and exercises, students will develop skills in creating precise and coherent ontological models, and learn how to apply formal ontology to various fields such as biology, geography, and social sciences.

### **ONT 302. Ontology & Epistemology**

An integrative course examining the intersection of ontology and epistemology. Students will study how ontological assumptions influence theories of knowledge, focusing on belief structures, justification, and reality. The course will cover key epistemological theories and their ontological underpinnings, as well as contemporary debates on the nature of truth, knowledge, and reality. Students will engage in critical analysis of philosophical texts, participate in debates, and write essays that explore the connections between ontology and epistemology.

### **ONT 303. Ontology for Social Systems**

A specialized course on the application of ontological frameworks to social structures and networks. Topics include social ontology, collective intentionality, and the representation of roles, institutions, and groups. Students will examine how ontological theories can be used to analyze and model social phenomena, such as social interactions, power dynamics, and organizational structures. The course includes case studies, group projects, and discussions on the practical implications of social ontology for fields such as sociology, anthropology, and political science.

### **ONT 401. Ontology & AI Integration**

This course investigates how ontologies are used in artificial intelligence to enhance reasoning, knowledge representation, and data integration. Practical case studies on AI systems and knowledge graphs are emphasized. Students will learn about the role of ontologies in machine learning, natural language processing, and intelligent agents. The course includes hands-on projects where students will develop and implement ontological models for AI applications, as well as discussions on the ethical and technical challenges of integrating ontology with AI.

### **ONT 402. Ontological Research Methods**

A methodological course focused on conducting research in ontology, including both theoretical and applied approaches. Students will develop skills in literature review, hypothesis formation, and ontology-based analysis. The course covers various research methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative methods, and provides guidance on designing and conducting ontological research projects. Students will work on individual and group research projects, present their findings, and receive feedback on their research design and execution.

### **ONT 403. Ontology in Decision Support Systems**

An applied course on using ontology for decision-making in complex environments. Students will study ontology-driven decision support tools in fields such as healthcare, governance, and finance. Topics include the design and implementation of ontological models for decision support, the integration of ontologies with decision support systems, and the evaluation of ontology-based decision-making processes. The course includes case studies, practical assignments, and discussions on the benefits and limitations of using ontology in decision support.

### **ONT 499. Capstone in Ontological Research**

A culminating research project where students synthesize their knowledge to address a specific ontological question or develop an applied ontology framework. The capstone includes both written and presentation components. Students will work closely with faculty advisors to design and execute their research projects, conduct thorough literature reviews, and apply ontological theories and methods to their chosen topics. The course culminates in a final presentation and defense of their research findings, demonstrating their ability to conduct independent, high-quality ontological research.
