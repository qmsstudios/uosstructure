### DTH 101. Introduction to Decision Theory

An introductory course on the principles of decision theory, focusing on how individuals and groups make decisions under conditions of certainty, risk, and uncertainty. Topics include rational choice models and utility theory.

### DTH 102. Behavioral Decision-Making

This course examines how human decision-making often deviates from rational models, focusing on cognitive biases, heuristics, and emotional influences on choices.

### DTH 201. Game Theory & Strategic Thinking

A foundational course on game theory and its applications in strategic decision-making. Students will explore concepts such as Nash equilibrium, dominant strategies, and cooperative vs. non-cooperative games.

### DTH 202. Probability & Uncertainty in Decision-Making

A study of probabilistic reasoning and its role in decision-making under uncertainty. Topics include Bayesian reasoning, probability estimation, and risk assessment.

### DTH 203. Rational Choice & Optimization Models

This course explores models of rational decision-making and optimization techniques used in various fields such as economics, management, and artificial intelligence.

### DTH 301. Decision-Making Under Risk & Ambiguity

A practical course on how individuals and organizations make decisions when outcomes are uncertain. Topics include ambiguity aversion, risk perception, and real-world decision contexts.

### DTH 302. Cognitive Biases & Heuristics

An in-depth exploration of cognitive shortcuts and biases that affect decision-making. Students will analyze examples such as framing effects, anchoring, and availability heuristics.

### DTH 303. Judgment & Decision Processes

A course on how humans form judgments and make decisions. Students will learn about dual-process theories of thinking, intuitive vs. deliberative reasoning, and the psychology of judgment.

### DTH 401. Social Decision-Making & Group Dynamics

This course focuses on decision-making in social contexts, including group decision-making, conformity, and the dynamics of collective choices.

### DTH 402. Decision Support Systems & Tools

An applied course on designing and using decision support systems in various domains. Students will explore data-driven decision-making tools and their applications in business, healthcare, and public policy.

### DTH 403. Advanced Topics in Decision Theory

A seminar-style course exploring current research and emerging trends in decision theory. Students will engage in case studies, research projects, and group discussions.

### DTH 499. Capstone in Decision Science

A comprehensive research project where students integrate their knowledge of decision theory to address a real-world decision problem. The capstone involves research, analysis, and a final presentation.
