### QCO 101. Introduction to Quantum Cognition

An overview of quantum cognition, exploring how concepts from quantum theory apply to human decision-making and cognitive processes. Students will learn about the foundations of probabilistic cognition and mental states.

### QCO 102. Cognitive Superposition & Interference

This course examines how cognitive states can exist in superposed forms until focus collapses them into specific outcomes. Topics include cognitive interference, uncertainty, and parallel thought processes.

### QCO 201. Quantum Decision Theory

A specialized course on decision-making through the lens of quantum probability. Students will analyze how quantum models provide alternative explanations for choices under uncertainty.

### QCO 202. Cognitive Measurement & Collapse

A study of how attention and conscious focus act as a measurement process that collapses cognitive superposition into specific outcomes. Students will explore implications for perception, memory, and decision-making.

### QCO 203. Quantum Mind Theory

An advanced course on quantum mind theory, focusing on how molecular energy subdivisions form distinct cognitive dimensions. Students will explore connections between neuroscience and quantum frameworks.

### QCO 301. Non-Local Cognition & Perception

A theoretical course on non-local cognition, which explores consciousness as a fundamental phenomenon beyond time and space. Topics include distant perception, mental connectivity, and intuition.

### QCO 302. Probabilistic Reasoning & Uncertainty

This course focuses on reasoning under uncertainty, drawing on quantum probability theory. Students will compare classical and quantum models of belief updating and prediction.

### QCO 303. Quantum Wave Functions in Cognitive States

An exploration of how cognitive states can be represented as wave functions. Students will learn about wave interference, amplitude, and the role of probabilities in cognitive processes.

### QCO 401. Cognitive Entanglement & Mental States

A deep dive into cognitive entanglement, studying how mental states are intrinsically linked across psychodynamic dimensions. Case studies will examine shared mental phenomena and emotional synchronization.

### QCO 402. Sequential Influence in Cognitive Processing

A course on how the sequence of information presentation influences cognitive outcomes. Topics include order effects, framing, and temporal dynamics in decision-making.

### QCO 403. Advanced Topics in Quantum Cognition

A seminar exploring cutting-edge research and emerging topics in quantum cognition. Students will engage with experimental data, recent publications, and debates in the field.

### QCO 499. Capstone in Quantum Cognition Research

A culminating research project where students synthesize their knowledge of quantum cognition in a comprehensive thesis or applied project. The capstone involves both written and presentation components.
