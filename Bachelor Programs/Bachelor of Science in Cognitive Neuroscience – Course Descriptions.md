Students will explore the relationship between brain function and behavior. The course includes lectures, discussions, and hands-on activities to provide a comprehensive understanding of cognitive neuroscience principles.

### CNS 102. Neural Dynamics & Cognitive Processes

This course focuses on the dynamic processes in the brain that support cognition. Topics include neural oscillations, synaptic plasticity, and the temporal coordination of neural activity. Students will learn about the latest research methods and tools used to study neural dynamics, and will participate in laboratory exercises to apply these concepts.

### CNS 201. Neuroanatomy & Brain Function

A detailed examination of the structure and function of the brain and nervous system. Students will study brain regions and their roles in cognition, behavior, and emotion. The course includes dissections, imaging studies, and interactive models to enhance understanding of neuroanatomy.

### CNS 202. Neural Basis of Perception & Attention

A study of the neural systems that support sensory perception and attention. Topics include visual processing, auditory perception, and attentional control mechanisms. Students will engage in experiments and data analysis to explore how the brain processes sensory information and directs attention.

### CNS 203. Neuroplasticity & Brain Adaptation

This course explores how the brain changes and adapts in response to experience and injury. Students will learn about mechanisms of neuroplasticity and their implications for learning and rehabilitation. The course includes case studies, research projects, and guest lectures from experts in the field.

### CNS 301. Memory Systems & Cognitive Aging

An in-depth analysis of memory systems in the brain and how they are affected by aging. Topics include short-term memory, long-term memory, and the impact of neurodegenerative diseases. Students will review current research, participate in memory assessments, and discuss strategies for cognitive health in aging.

### CNS 302. Emotion, Motivation, & Decision-Making

A study of the neural circuits involved in emotion and motivation, with a focus on how these processes influence decision-making. The course covers theories of emotion, the role of neurotransmitters, and the impact of emotional states on cognitive functions. Students will conduct experiments and analyze data related to emotional and motivational processes.

### CNS 303. Neuroimaging Techniques & Analysis

An introduction to neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI, EEG, and PET. Students will gain hands-on experience in analyzing neuroimaging data. The course includes practical sessions on data acquisition, preprocessing, and statistical analysis, as well as discussions on the interpretation of neuroimaging findings.

### CNS 401. Cognitive Neuroscience of Learning & Development

This course examines how the brain supports learning and cognitive development across the lifespan. Topics include early childhood brain development and adult learning processes. Students will explore developmental milestones, learning theories, and the impact of environmental factors on cognitive development through research projects and presentations.

### CNS 402. Psychophysiology & Behavioral Neuroscience

A course on the relationship between physiological processes and behavior. Students will explore autonomic responses, stress, and the psychophysiological basis of mental states. The course includes laboratory experiments, biofeedback training, and analysis of physiological data to understand the links between the body and behavior.

### CNS 403. Advanced Topics in Cognitive Neuroscience

A seminar-style course on emerging research and advanced topics in cognitive neuroscience. Students will engage in discussions, independent research, and case studies. The course covers cutting-edge topics such as brain-computer interfaces, neuroethics, and the application of cognitive neuroscience in technology and medicine.

### CNS 499. Capstone in Cognitive Neuroscience

A culminating research project where students synthesize their knowledge of cognitive neuroscience to conduct a comprehensive study or applied project. Students will work under the guidance of a faculty advisor to design, execute, and present their research. The capstone project includes a written report, oral presentation, and peer review.
