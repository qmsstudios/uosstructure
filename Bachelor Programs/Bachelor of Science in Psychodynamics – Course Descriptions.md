## PSY 102 – Personality Theory and Development (3 credits)  
Examines classical and contemporary theories of personality development. Students will explore how personality is shaped by early experiences, unconscious processes, and cognitive structures. The course includes in-depth analyses of major personality theories and their applications in psychological practice.

## PSY 103 – Cognitive and Unconscious Processes (3 credits)  
Investigates the relationship between conscious and unconscious mental processes. Topics include subliminal perception, implicit memory, and the role of unconscious biases in decision-making. Students will review empirical research and participate in experiments to understand these complex processes.

## CNS 102 – Neural Basis of Emotion and Memory (3 credits)  
Explores the neurological underpinnings of emotion and memory, focusing on how brain structures such as the amygdala and hippocampus regulate emotional responses and memory consolidation. The course includes laboratory sessions to examine neural activity and its correlation with emotional and memory functions.

## PSY 104 – Human Development and Psychodynamic Perspectives (3 credits)  
Examines the psychodynamic theories of human development, focusing on attachment, identity formation, and the impact of early experiences on adult personality. Students will analyze case studies and developmental research to understand the long-term effects of early life experiences.

## PSY 201 – Defense Mechanisms and Coping Strategies (3 credits)  
A study of defense mechanisms such as repression, projection, and denial, and their role in coping with stress, trauma, and psychological conflicts. The course includes practical exercises and role-playing scenarios to illustrate the use of defense mechanisms in everyday life.

## CEN 205 – Computational Models of Mind and Behavior (3 credits)  
Explores computational approaches to modeling cognition, including neural networks, cognitive architectures, and machine learning models inspired by human thought processes. Students will develop and test computational models to simulate cognitive functions and behaviors.

## PSY 202 – Trauma, Memory, and Psychological Healing (3 credits)  
Examines the impact of trauma on cognition and emotional regulation. Topics include PTSD, memory distortion, and therapeutic interventions for trauma recovery. The course includes case studies and therapeutic techniques to address trauma-related psychological issues.

## PSY 203 – Applied Psychodynamic Analysis (3 credits)  
Provides hands-on applications of psychodynamic theories in research and practice. Students will analyze case studies and conduct psychodynamic assessments. The course emphasizes practical skills in psychodynamic evaluation and intervention.

## CNS 204 – Neural Circuits and Cognitive Function (3 credits)  
Explores the role of neural circuits in cognition, perception, and executive function, with a focus on brain connectivity and information processing. Students will participate in laboratory experiments to study neural circuit functions and their impact on cognitive abilities.

## PSY 204 – Psychodynamics in Social and Cultural Contexts (3 credits)  
Analyzes the influence of social and cultural factors on psychodynamic processes. Topics include collective unconscious, cultural narratives, and identity formation. The course includes discussions and projects on the interplay between individual psychology and societal influences.

## PSY 301 – Consciousness and the Self: Psychodynamic Perspectives (3 credits)  
Investigates theories of self-awareness and consciousness in psychodynamic psychology. Topics include self-concept, identity crises, and the role of the unconscious. Students will engage in reflective exercises and theoretical analyses to explore the nature of consciousness and self.

## CEN 303 – Advanced Topics in Cognitive Science (3 credits)  
Explores emerging research in cognitive science, including attention, perception, learning, and the integration of cognitive models with psychodynamic theory. The course includes research projects and presentations on cutting-edge topics in cognitive science.

## PSY 302 – Psychodynamics of Relationships and Attachment (3 credits)  
Examines interpersonal relationships from a psychodynamic perspective, including attachment theory, emotional dependency, and unconscious relational patterns. Students will analyze relationship dynamics through case studies and theoretical frameworks.

## PSY 303 – Emotion Regulation and Cognitive Reappraisal (3 credits)  
Studies emotional regulation strategies, cognitive reframing techniques, and their applications in therapeutic and everyday settings. The course includes practical exercises and role-playing to develop skills in emotion regulation and cognitive reappraisal.

## PSY 304 – Psychodynamic Research Methods (3 credits)  
Covers qualitative and quantitative research methodologies used in psychodynamic studies, including case studies, longitudinal research, and projective testing. Students will design and conduct research projects to apply these methodologies in psychodynamic contexts.

## PSY 305 – Neuropsychology and Psychodynamic Theory (3 credits)  
Explores the intersection of neuropsychology and psychodynamics, examining how brain function influences unconscious processes, personality, and behavior. The course includes laboratory sessions and case studies to illustrate the neuropsychological basis of psychodynamic concepts.

## PSY 401 – Independent Research in Psychodynamics (3 credits)  
A student-led research project focused on advanced topics in psychodynamics, allowing for in-depth study and critical analysis of psychological theories. Students will work independently under faculty supervision to complete their research projects.

## PSY 402 – Integrative Psychodynamic Analysis (3 credits)  
A capstone seminar where students synthesize key psychodynamic theories and apply them to real-world psychological phenomena. The course includes comprehensive projects and presentations to demonstrate integrative understanding of psychodynamic principles.

## PSY 403 – Senior Seminar: Theories of Self and Mind (3 credits)  
Explores advanced theories of self, mind, and consciousness, integrating perspectives from psychodynamics, cognitive science, and philosophy. Students will engage in critical discussions and research projects to explore these complex theories.

## PSY 404 – Capstone Project: Psychodynamic Research Study (6 credits)  
A comprehensive research project where students apply psychodynamic theories to original research, case studies, or applied psychological analysis. The course includes extensive research and writing components to produce a significant scholarly work.

## PSY 405 – Emerging Perspectives in Psychodynamic Psychology (3 credits)  
Examines contemporary research and emerging theories in psychodynamic psychology, including neuro-psychodynamic approaches and modern adaptations of classical theories. The course includes literature reviews and research projects on current trends in psychodynamic psychology.

## Final Research Elective or Internship (3 credits)  
Students complete a research elective or internship in a relevant area of psychodynamics, gaining hands-on experience in research or applied settings. The course includes practical work and reflective assignments to integrate academic learning with professional practice.
