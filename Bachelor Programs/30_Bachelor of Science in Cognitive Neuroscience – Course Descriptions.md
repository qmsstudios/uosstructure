### CNS 101. Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience

An introductory course on the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes such as perception, memory, attention, and decision-making. Students will explore the relationship between brain function and behavior.

### CNS 102. Neural Dynamics & Cognitive Processes

This course focuses on the dynamic processes in the brain that support cognition. Topics include neural oscillations, synaptic plasticity, and the temporal coordination of neural activity.

### CNS 201. Neuroanatomy & Brain Function

A detailed examination of the structure and function of the brain and nervous system. Students will study brain regions and their roles in cognition, behavior, and emotion.

### CNS 202. Neural Basis of Perception & Attention

A study of the neural systems that support sensory perception and attention. Topics include visual processing, auditory perception, and attentional control mechanisms.

### CNS 203. Neuroplasticity & Brain Adaptation

This course explores how the brain changes and adapts in response to experience and injury. Students will learn about mechanisms of neuroplasticity and their implications for learning and rehabilitation.

### CNS 301. Memory Systems & Cognitive Aging

An in-depth analysis of memory systems in the brain and how they are affected by aging. Topics include short-term memory, long-term memory, and the impact of neurodegenerative diseases.

### CNS 302. Emotion, Motivation, & Decision-Making

A study of the neural circuits involved in emotion and motivation, with a focus on how these processes influence decision-making.

### CNS 303. Neuroimaging Techniques & Analysis

An introduction to neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI, EEG, and PET. Students will gain hands-on experience in analyzing neuroimaging data.

### CNS 401. Cognitive Neuroscience of Learning & Development

This course examines how the brain supports learning and cognitive development across the lifespan. Topics include early childhood brain development and adult learning processes.

### CNS 402. Psychophysiology & Behavioral Neuroscience

A course on the relationship between physiological processes and behavior. Students will explore autonomic responses, stress, and the psychophysiological basis of mental states.

### CNS 403. Advanced Topics in Cognitive Neuroscience

A seminar-style course on emerging research and advanced topics in cognitive neuroscience. Students will engage in discussions, independent research, and case studies.

### CNS 499. Capstone in Cognitive Neuroscience

A culminating research project where students synthesize their knowledge of cognitive neuroscience to conduct a comprehensive study or applied project.
