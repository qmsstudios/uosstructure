**Department of Quantum Cognition – University of Ontological Science (UOS)**

### **About the Program**

The **B.Sc. in Quantum Cognition** explores the **intersection of quantum theory and cognitive science**, examining how **quantum principles influence perception, decision-making, and neural processing**. Students will engage with **non-classical probability models, quantum-inspired decision theories, and psychodynamic wave functions**, developing a **new paradigm of human cognition based on quantum mechanics**.

This program integrates **quantum probability, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and AI modeling**, preparing graduates for roles in **cognitive science, artificial intelligence, psychometric research, and decision theory**.
