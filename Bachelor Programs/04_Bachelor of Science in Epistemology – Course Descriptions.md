**EPI 101. Introduction to Epistemology**

An introductory course on the study of knowledge, focusing on foundational questions such as what knowledge is, how it is acquired, and what distinguishes justified belief from opinion. Students will explore classical and contemporary theories of knowledge.

**EPI 102. Theory of Knowledge**

A detailed exploration of key concepts in the theory of knowledge, including skepticism, sources of knowledge (perception, reason, memory), and the nature of justification. This course provides a comprehensive framework for understanding epistemic inquiry.

**EPI 201. Justification & Belief Systems**

This course examines the structure and dynamics of belief systems, focusing on what constitutes justification for holding a belief. Topics include coherence, foundationalism, and reliabilism.

**EPI 202. Cognitive Epistemology**

An interdisciplinary approach to epistemology that draws on cognitive science to understand how humans acquire and process knowledge. Students will study topics such as mental models, heuristics, and cognitive biases.

**EPI 203. Foundations of Perception & Reality**

A philosophical and scientific examination of perception and its role in shaping our understanding of reality. Students will explore the relationship between sensory experiences and the external world.

**EPI 301. Epistemic Logic & Reasoning**

A specialized course on formal reasoning and epistemic logic, focusing on how logical systems represent knowledge, belief, and informational states. Applications in artificial intelligence and decision theory are highlighted.

**EPI 302. Social Epistemology**

A study of the social dimensions of knowledge, including collective belief, epistemic authority, and the role of institutions in shaping public knowledge. Case studies on misinformation and consensus-building are emphasized.

**EPI 303. Knowledge Representation & Information Flow**

This course covers methods for representing knowledge in structured systems. Students will explore ontologies, knowledge graphs, and the flow of information in networks and databases.

**EPI 401. Computational Epistemology**

An advanced course that bridges epistemology and computational methods. Students will analyze how computational models represent knowledge acquisition, belief structures, and reasoning processes.

**EPI 402. Epistemology in Artificial Intelligence**

A specialized course on the role of epistemology in AI, focusing on knowledge representation, reasoning, and machine learning. Students will study how AI systems process and evaluate knowledge.

**EPI 403. Advanced Topics in Epistemology**

A seminar-style course exploring emerging topics in epistemology, such as virtual epistemology, epistemic injustice, and the impact of technology on human knowledge. Students will engage in discussions and independent research.

**EPI 499. Capstone in Epistemic Research**

A research-intensive project where students synthesize their knowledge of epistemology in a comprehensive thesis or applied project. The capstone focuses on integrating theory with practical applications.
