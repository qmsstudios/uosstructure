The Bachelor of Science in Metaphysics offers a comprehensive exploration of the fundamental nature of reality, existence, causality, and the structure of being. This program is tailored for students eager to integrate classical and contemporary metaphysical theories with cutting-edge scientific paradigms such as quantum mechanics, consciousness studies, and computational metaphysics.

## **About the Program**

The Bachelor of Science in Metaphysics provides an in-depth academic foundation in understanding the principles and structures that define reality. Students will engage with a range of metaphysical concepts including ontological structures, metaphysical logic, modal realism, and the philosophy of time, space, and existence. This program bridges philosophical inquiry with the empirical rigor of modern science, encouraging students to apply theoretical insights to practical scenarios in philosophy, theoretical science, and artificial intelligence modeling.

Through a curriculum that combines historical perspectives with contemporary scientific approaches, students will develop a nuanced understanding of how metaphysical principles impact our understanding of the universe and cognitive processes. The program emphasizes critical thinking, logical analysis, and the ability to articulate complex ideas clearly and effectively.

### **Key Areas of Study**

**Ontological Structures and Their Implications

**Metaphysical Logic and Modal Realism

**Philosophy of Time, Space, and Existence

**Integration of Metaphysical Theories with Quantum Mechanics

**Computational Metaphysics and Its Applications

### **Career Pathways**

Graduates of the Bachelor of Science in Metaphysics are well-prepared for roles in philosophy, theoretical science, and advanced technology sectors, particularly in areas that require deep understanding of the underlying principles of reality and existence. The program also provides a strong foundation for further graduate studies in philosophy, quantum mechanics, and computational modeling.
