Investigates the role of symbolism and archetypes in shaping human cognition. Students will examine mythological, cultural, and psychological symbols as tools for structuring knowledge and perception. The course includes practical exercises in symbolic analysis and the exploration of archetypal patterns in various cultural contexts.

### ESS 104 – Sacred Geometry & The Mathematics of Reality (3 credits)  

A study of geometric structures and their metaphysical significance. Topics include fractals, mathematical harmony in nature, and the esoteric implications of geometric principles. Students will engage in hands-on activities to understand the connection between geometry and the fabric of reality.

### ESS 105 – The Science of Mysticism & Higher Cognition (3 credits)  

Examines mystical traditions and their cognitive and psychological impact. Students will analyze historical and modern interpretations of altered states of consciousness. The course includes experiential components such as meditation and guided visualization to explore higher states of awareness.

### ESS 106 – Transdisciplinary Approaches to Esoteric Knowledge (3 credits)  

Investigates how esoteric science intersects with fields such as physics, psychology, and epistemology. The course emphasizes interdisciplinary synthesis and critical analysis. Students will develop skills in integrating diverse knowledge systems and applying them to contemporary scientific and philosophical questions.

### ESS 201 – Hermetic Systems & Theoretical Frameworks (3 credits)  

An exploration of hermetic principles, ancient wisdom traditions, and their applications in contemporary thought. Topics include the seven hermetic laws and their cognitive significance. Students will engage in comparative analysis of hermetic teachings and modern scientific theories.

### ESS 202 – The Role of Metaphor in Cognitive Science (3 credits)  

Examines how metaphors shape human understanding and communication. Students will analyze their role in mythology, linguistics, and conceptual thought. The course includes practical exercises in metaphorical thinking and its application in various fields of study.

### ESS 203 – Non-Ordinary States of Consciousness & Knowledge Processing (3 credits)  

Investigates altered states of consciousness, such as lucid dreaming, trance, and peak experiences, as mechanisms for knowledge acquisition and cognitive expansion. Students will explore techniques for inducing and studying these states and their implications for personal and collective knowledge.

### ESS 204 – Multidimensional Thought & Perception Structuring (3 credits)  

Explores theoretical models of multidimensional awareness and their implications for human cognition and reality construction. The course includes discussions on the nature of dimensions, consciousness, and the potential for expanding human perception.

### ESS 205 – The Intersection of Esoteric Science & Quantum Theory (3 credits)  

Examines parallels between esoteric knowledge and quantum mechanics, including wave function collapse, non-locality, and consciousness-based interpretations of reality. Students will engage in critical analysis of scientific and esoteric perspectives on the nature of reality.

### ESS 206 – The Physics of Consciousness & Reality Modeling (3 credits)  

Investigates theories proposing that consciousness is fundamental to reality, drawing from neuroscience, theoretical physics, and metaphysical traditions. The course includes discussions on the implications of these theories for understanding the nature of existence and human experience.

### ESS 301 – Philosophical Implications of Hidden Knowledge Systems (3 credits)  

Examines the impact of esoteric knowledge on philosophy, epistemology, and ontology, with discussions on secrecy, initiation, and the nature of hidden wisdom. Students will explore the ethical and philosophical questions raised by esoteric traditions and their influence on human thought.

### ESS 302 – Theoretical Cosmology & Higher-Dimensional Physics (3 credits)  

Investigates esoteric cosmological models alongside modern physics, including hyperdimensional theories and the nature of spacetime. The course includes comparative analysis of ancient and contemporary cosmological theories and their implications for understanding the universe.

### ESS 303 – Archetypal Patterns in Human & Cosmic Systems (3 credits)  

Explores recurring archetypal patterns in mythology, history, and the natural world, analyzing their role in shaping human consciousness. Students will engage in the study of archetypes across different cultures and their significance in personal and collective development.

### ESS 304 – Ancient Knowledge Systems & Their Modern Applications (3 credits)  

Investigates ancient knowledge traditions and their relevance in contemporary thought and technology. The course includes case studies of ancient practices and their modern applications in fields such as medicine, architecture, and environmental science.

### ESS 305 – Ontological Models of Spiritual & Cognitive Evolution (3 credits)  

Explores theories of consciousness and spiritual evolution in relation to ontological structures. Students will examine different models of spiritual development and their implications for personal growth and societal transformation.

### ESS 306 – Advanced Studies in Esoteric Psychology (3 credits)  

Examines the intersection of esoteric traditions and psychology, focusing on altered states, archetypal influences, and self-transcendence. The course includes practical exercises in esoteric psychological techniques and their application in therapeutic settings.

### ESS 401 – Independent Research in Esoteric Science (3 credits)
