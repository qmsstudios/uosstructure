The Bachelor of Science in Consciousness Studies delves into the fundamental nature of awareness, altered states, perception structuring, and the intersections of cognitive science with philosophy. This program is designed for students eager to explore transcendent cognition, quantum consciousness models, and higher-order awareness states, providing a deep understanding of how mind, matter, and perception interconnect.

**About the Program**

The B.S. in Consciousness Studies offers a comprehensive curriculum that examines the complex phenomena of consciousness through a multidisciplinary lens. Students will engage with theories and research from cognitive science, philosophy, and transpersonal psychology to explore the structure and dynamics of consciousness. This program emphasizes critical thinking and empirical research, encouraging students to investigate various states of awareness and their implications for understanding human cognition and behavior.

Through coursework and hands-on research, students will examine transcendent cognition, delve into quantum consciousness models, and study higher-order awareness states to uncover the intricate ways in which consciousness influences and is influenced by our perception of reality.
