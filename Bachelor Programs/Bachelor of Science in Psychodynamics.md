# Bachelor of Science in Psychodynamics (B.S.P.)

The **Bachelor of Science in Psychodynamics** delves into the complex interplay between unconscious processes, cognition, and behavior, offering a comprehensive understanding of psychological forces that shape human experience. Blending classical psychodynamic theories with modern approaches in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and quantum cognition, this program is designed for students who seek a deep, integrative perspective on the human mind.

## About the Program

The **Bachelor of Science in Psychodynamics** provides an interdisciplinary approach to understanding psychological development, unconscious processes, and the dynamics of personality and behavior. This program integrates traditional psychodynamic concepts—such as defense mechanisms, unconscious motivation, and transference—with contemporary research in cognitive science and neural models of consciousness. Students will explore how internal conflicts, early life experiences, and cognitive processes influence behavior and perception, equipping them with the skills to analyze human behavior through both classical and modern lenses.

Emphasizing both theory and applied research, the program offers opportunities for students to study psychodynamic principles in diverse contexts such as developmental psychology, trauma studies, and personality dynamics. Graduates will leave with a strong foundation in psychological theory, self-reflective analysis, and psychodynamic research methodologies.
