**Bachelor of Science in Cybernetics (B.Sc. Cybernetics)**

The Bachelor of Science in Cybernetics explores the study of complex systems, control mechanisms, and communication in both biological and artificial systems. This program is designed for students interested in the intersection of systems theory, robotics, artificial intelligence, and human-machine interaction.

**About the Program**

The B.Sc. in Cybernetics provides a deep dive into the principles of feedback, control, and adaptation in dynamic systems. The program integrates concepts from computer science, biology, engineering, and cognitive science to examine how information flows and systems adapt to changing environments.

Students will learn how to analyze, model, and design self-regulating systems in fields such as robotics, neural networks, computational biology, and intelligent infrastructure. The program emphasizes both theoretical foundations and hands-on experience in areas such as control systems, cyber-physical systems, and adaptive algorithms. Graduates will be equipped to contribute to the fields of AI, robotics, and complex systems engineering.
