The Bachelor of Science in Decision Theory provides a comprehensive exploration of decision-making frameworks, cognitive processes, and mathematical models that shape human and artificial decision-making. This program is designed for students who want to gain expertise in rational choice theory, probabilistic reasoning, and strategic decision analysis, preparing them to navigate complex systems in areas like economics, artificial intelligence, business strategy, and cognitive science.

**About the Program**

The B.Sc. in Decision Theory equips students with the analytical and critical thinking skills needed to understand and model decision-making in uncertain environments. The program combines cognitive science, mathematics, and behavioral economics with cutting-edge applications in artificial intelligence and strategic planning. Students will engage with real-world case studies and advanced computational tools to develop innovative solutions for decision-making challenges in various fields.

The curriculum covers core topics such as game theory, cognitive decision modeling, risk assessment, and Bayesian inference. This interdisciplinary approach ensures that graduates are equipped to design decision-support systems and optimize strategic choices in both human and machine contexts.
